    <p style={paragraphStyle}>
      If youâ€™re visiting Rome, take the time to slow down and truly savour the experienceâ€”thereâ€™s so much beauty, incredible Italian food, and while itâ€™s undeniably touristy, the vibes are amazing. People from all over the world are sharing in the joy of what, for many, is a once-in-a-lifetime trip. Be sure to toss a coin into the fountain to come back again! The love in the air is palpable and we found that people were always happy to offer to take a photo of Tyler and me, and we gladly returned the favour. Rome is filled with smiles and good vibes.
