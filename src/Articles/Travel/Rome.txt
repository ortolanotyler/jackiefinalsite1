    <p style={paragraphStyle}>
      On our last day in Rome, we took it easy, wandering around to pick up souvenirs. I always wait until the last day to make sure Iâ€™m confident in my purchases. I found adorable party favours for the wedding, like little limoncello bottles and lemon candies, at a store called Limonâ€™e. While the store was super fun, I later discovered that similar items were much cheaper in Sorrento, so if youâ€™re traveling to multiple destinations in Italy, keep that in mind!

      Some classic souvenirs from Rome include leather goods, handmade sandals, Murano glass (originating from Venice but found in Rome as well) and beautiful postcardsâ€”perfect for journaling. If youâ€™re into quirky finds, thereâ€™s a shop full of rubber ducks near the Trevi Fountain thatâ€™s worth a visit! Luckily, I waited to purchase leather goods in Sorrento!

      After one last stroll around the city, we capped off our Roman adventure by taking a taxi to the train station. From there, we hopped on a train to Naples. If youâ€™re looking to splurge on a souvenir, thereâ€™s a Bricks Milano store at the Naples terminal for gorgeous leather luggage, but I decided to save it for another trip.

      We took a cab to the ferry and made our way to the breathtaking shores of Sorrento. Cab drivers may pressure you into taking them the whole way, but I recommend sticking to the ferryâ€”itâ€™s cheaper and offers stunning views as you approach Sorrento. The driving in Naples is nuts!

    <p style={paragraphStyle}>
      If youâ€™re visiting Rome, take the time to slow down and truly savour the experienceâ€”thereâ€™s so much beauty, incredible Italian food, and while itâ€™s undeniably touristy, the vibes are amazing. People from all over the world are sharing in the joy of what, for many, is a once-in-a-lifetime trip. Be sure to toss a coin into the fountain to come back again! The love in the air is palpable and we found that people were always happy to offer to take a photo of Tyler and me, and we gladly returned the favour. Rome is filled with smiles and good vibes.
