            <h2 style={headingStyle}> üåü First Impressions and Ambiance</h2>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
            Upon arrival at Fable Auckland on Queen Street, we were excited by the bustling shopping strip featuring luxury shops and elegant building
            facades. The grand stone entrance, adorned with a stunning chandelier, welcomed us warmly along with the friendly concierge.The hotel is styled to transport you to an era of refined elegance, with quirky details like gold sculptures of animals you‚Äôd find in a storybook üêá . We checked in through the glass doors in the lobby of <strong> Cooke‚Äôs restaurant </strong>, and then headed up the elevator to our room before exploring the city.            </p>

            <h2 style={headingStyle}> ü´ñ Room Options and Accommodations</h2>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
         
Fable Auckland offers a variety of guest rooms and suites, each elegantly decorated with modern amenities in an <strong>Art Deco  </strong> design. We chose the
Classic King room, featuring a plush king-sized <strong> ‚ÄòSofitel My Bed‚Äô </strong>, Smart TV, Bose speakers, and high-speed WiFi. The bed was incredibly comfortable, ensuring great nights of sleep despite the time difference. A feature I loved at this hotel was their china tea sets from the brand T2 Tea. If you adore it and want to take a set home, the china shop is also along the shopping strip!
</p>
            <div style={gridContainerStyle}>
            <img src={images[2]} alt="Maui room 1" style={imageStyle} />
            <img src={images[3]} alt="Maui room 2" style={imageStyle} />
            <img src={images[4]} alt="Maui room 3" style={imageStyle} />
            <img src={images[5]} alt="Maui room 4" style={imageStyle} />
            </div>

            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
            There are various room options, from the Classic Queen to Luxury Rooms and Suites. The prime option is the <strong> Windsor Suite </strong>, with two spacious bedrooms, a balcony, and more luxury amenities. That being said, I was very
pleased with the Classic King, and it was large enough to comfortably stay with my mom. The shower was great with a dual shower system, featuring both a rainfall shower head and a handheld shower head.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>

Fable Auckland also provides a range of guest services, including a <strong>24-hour reception, room service, valet parking, dry-cleaning, and laundry services. </strong>
The on-site restaurant, Cooke's, offers exceptional dining experiences, with a focus on natural, free-range, and organic ingredients. Guests can also enjoy the hotel's fitness centre, hot tub, and sauna for added relaxation, though my mom and I were busy exploring the city as pictured below!

    üíµ Cost Considerations: Pros and Cons
</h2>


<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Staying at the upscale Fable Auckland comes with a reasonable price tag, making it a great value for the luxurious experience offered. During our stay, we paid about $120 CAD per night (approximately $90 USD or $136 NZD), which felt thoroughly justified by the hotel‚Äôs exceptional service, luxurious atmosphere, and unparalleled location on Queen Street.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
Although there was an issue with the heating in our room, which required us to call down repeatedly since we couldn't manually change the heat, the hotel staff were very
accommodating and comped us a fabulous breakfast because of it. This minor inconvenience was easily overshadowed by the overall quality of our stay.

</p>


<h2 style={headingStyle}> 
    ü´ñ Dining at Cooke's Restaurant

</h2>


<p style={paragraphStyle}>
Cooke's Restaurant at Fable Auckland offers a phenomenal dining experience. We particularly enjoyed their cappuccinos, which were some of
the best we've ever had. The restaurant's elegant setting and diverse menu made every meal a delight. They also offer a high tea experience, featuring a selection of finely crafted tea blends accompanied by an assortment of traditional scones, pastries, and delicate finger sandwiches, all served in their colourful T2 Tea sets.

            üå∏ Nearby Attractions
            </h2>


            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
            Fable Auckland's location on Queen Street is ideal for exploring the city. The hotel is close to the ferry terminal, providing easy access to nearby islands like <strong> Waiheke </strong>. The area feels very safe and is bustling with amazing shops, including unique stores from Australia and New Zealand like Peter Alexander, Mecca, Ruby, as well as North American favourites like Sephora.

         <h2 style={headingStyle}>
         ü¶Ω Accessibility Note:

         </h2>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
Fable Auckland includes an elevator available for guest use, though there are stairs without ramps to get into the restaurant. I‚Äôd recommend calling beforehand to ensure there are accessibility features upon request. The city itself is fairly accessible, with wider sidewalks compared to most North American cities, and many public facilities are designed with accessibility in mind. Auckland also offers accessible public transportation options, including buses equipped with wheelchair ramps and priority seating. Additionally, many of the main attractions, such as the Auckland Museum and the Auckland Art Gallery, are equipped with accessible entrances and facilities.
