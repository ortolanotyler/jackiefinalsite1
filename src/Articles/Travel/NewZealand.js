            <DropCap text="Welcome to an epic travel vlog of my experience, flying from Toronto all the way to Auckland, New Zealand for a magical week halfway around the
world! I stayed at a whimsical hotel called Fable Auckland on Queen Street, and I have a full review of my experience here. But first, let‚Äôs talk about everything I did in the unforgettable week.
I traveled there with my mom, and we chose to do a mother-daughter trip because about six months ago, I connected with a bridal shop called Natalie
Rose Bridal on Instagram and decided to go there for a fitting!" />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
            It may seem extreme to fly all the way to New Zealand for a wedding dress, but I‚Äôve always wanted to visit Auckland, and I knew Natalie would find me the perfect dress. We instantly hit it off and had similar, fairytale-inspired styles.
            </p>
            <h2 style={headingStyle}>‚úà The Journey to Auckland</h2>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
            To get to Auckland, New Zealand, we took an Air Canada flight from Toronto to Vancouver and unfortunately had a really long layover. It ended
up being nice because it was a beautiful day, and we walked around downtown. Vancouver is magical on a beautiful summer day, and we walked along the Vancouver seawall and shared a thin-crust pizza from Cafe Villaggio.
I came across the Hello Kitty Caf√© in Vancouver, which was adorable, and I shopped around until heading back to the airport for our next flight to Fiji! It was a whopping 11 hours, and I was in a middle seat, but I was so excited finally getting off the plane to see tons of Whittaker's chocolate (a New Zealand chocolate company) at the Fiji airport to get me excited for the final three-hour journey landing in Auckland. When I say Whittaker‚Äôs chocolate is my favorite, I mean it. I ration it back home in Canada because it is hard to find!
            </p>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
            Travel Tip: When landing in Auckland, if you travel through the international airport, be aware that taxis tend to gouge prices, quoting $100 to get to Queen Street, whereas Uber was $60. However, the shuttle was $20 per person, so it ended up being $40 for both of us, and the service was great.
            </p>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
            We checked into Fable Auckland, which is super central and has beautiful decor! I especially loved all their tea sets, which are from T2 Tea, a brand born in Melbourne, Australia with unique patterns and bright colours.
            </p>

            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
            We landed in the morning and, after freshening up, we walked around Queen Street. There‚Äôs a beautiful mall atrium on Elliot Street across from the central square we explored. We were looking for a couple of items from the drugstore and checked out Life Pharmacy, Farmers, and Chemist Warehouse, New Zealand‚Äôs version of Shopper‚Äôs Drug Mart from Canada, and CVS in the US. I fell in love with some local shops like Creative & Brave and found so many earthy jewelry pieces with a fairy-like vibe, which is my favorite. We walked down to see the waterfront and got familiar with our new home for the week.
Chemist Warehouse was a bit overwhelming with so many products packed in there, but I did pick up a couple of McoBeauty items, an Australian brand known for duping Charlotte Tilbury!
We ate at Cooke‚Äôs Restaurant at the hotel once we got back from our day shopping. I had the best cappuccino I‚Äôve ever had in my life along with pumpkin ravioli, and my mom had the fish of the day. Both were amazing! Throughout our trip, we did not have one mediocre meal. Everything tasted fresh, and the presentation at cafes and restaurants was top-tier.
After forcing ourselves to stay up as long as possible, we had a great night‚Äôs sleep and were ready for day two!            </p>

            <h2 style={headingStyle}>üèù Day Two: More Shopping, Auckland Art Gallery & Waiheke Island
            </h2>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
            When I shop, I always take
pictures of things that I want and
then sit on them, so I went back to
the pharmacy and picked up some
Karen Murrell lipsticks, a New
Zealand brand with adorable
fashion illustrations on the
packaging. They are known for
being rich in natural pigment,
using organic, natural, and proven
safe chemical ingredients from
ethical and/or renewable sources.
Ethical & eco-friendly brands are a staple in New Zealand!
At Farmers, I picked up a whipped shower foam that looks like whipped cream from a brand called Sundae in the Pavlova scent, which I thought was perfect for the trip. My mom and I were definitely on the hunt for the best Pavlova while we were here. I also picked up a candle called Caramel Popcorn and Chops, which apparently is very nostalgic for New Zealanders and Australians when at the movie theatres. This is one of the best-smelling candles I‚Äôve ever had, especially if you like the smell of baked goods. As I‚Äôm writing this article, it‚Äôs burning and smells so sweet it makes me want a little treat. üòÄ
We tried Bird on a Wire, which is a chain restaurant known for fried chicken and chicken dishes but was also exceptional. I really enjoyed the Eggs Benedict. You really can‚Äôt go wrong in New Zealand for brunch food! We took a walk to the Auckland Art Gallery to see some local art as well. I picked up a card from their beautiful array of gifts at the museum, and we caught the ferry at the last minute and headed to Waiheke Island. Waiheke is now one of my favorite places I‚Äôve ever been!            </p>

                The property includes ADA-compliant rooms equipped with features such as roll-in showers, lowered storage solutions, and other assistive devices upon request. These accommodations are designed to offer comfort and convenience for guests with mobility challenges, ensuring a welcoming and inclusive environment for everyone. I always like to make an accessibility note, as unfortunately not all resorts feature these accommodations.

            <h2 style={headingStyle}>üå¥ Waiheke Island</h2>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
            Arriving on the island, we drove past a beach town on our way to Oneroa Beach. When you walked closer to the rocky area along the beach, there
were tons of seashells and trees growing out of the sides of the rocks, surrounded by beautiful crystal clear water. Truly a breathtaking view. I can only imagine how nice it would be to swim here in the summer.
The island is quite big, but we chose to walk from the beach through the surf town to the countryside to see the beautiful vineyards on our way to Mudbrick Vineyard and Restaurant. This was said to be one of the best
wineries in the world according to reviews, and I too had a great experience. While the restaurant was closed for a private event, my mom and I had an amazing drink outside watching the sunset and then had dinner at The Archive Bistro. The ambiance was candlelit with a beautiful fireplace. It was cozy, and the food was incredible, and my mom and I had great chats sitting by the fire. It was a public holiday when we went, so there was a surcharge, but it was definitely worth it. I‚Äôm not a wine drinker, so I had a cocktail, but my mom really enjoyed her red wine. An Uber took us back to the ferry to head back to the hotel.            </p>

            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
            I asked Natalie, the bridal shop owner, if she had any recommendations of places to visit while I was here in Auckland. She recommended checking
            out Ponsonby, which is a hip neighbourhood, and to go to Little & Friday, a local bakery. My mom and I split a breakfast quiche and their famous doughnut. I‚Äôm not typically a donut person, but it was an incredible pastry, and I can totally see why it is such a hit with the locals. The shopping strip had a bunch of eclectic shops like thrift stores, boutiques, and trendy caf√©s! I even went to a second cafe for another cappuccino since I‚Äôm a bit of a coffee addict, and the coffee here is superior. There were so many items that I loved in the Ponsonby shops.
                        </p>

                        <h2 style={headingStyle}>üë∞ Day Four: Bridal Appointment in Parnell</h2>

                       
            <img src={images[8]} alt="Maui luau" style={imageStyle} />
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
            The following day we headed to Parnell to visit Natalie Rose Bridal
to get a peek at my dress that was being made and to try on a bunch of Eva Lendel‚Äôs latest bridal collection! For more details about each dress I tried & a get ready with me for my hair and makeup, check out my beauty breakdown here.
Entering Natalie Rose Bridal on Parnell Street is so dreamy. It‚Äôs this
fairytale-inspired corner shop with white panels and pops of pink wainscoting. When you enter, there are gorgeous pink velvet curtains, gold bars filled with stunning bridal gowns sparkling from all the light coming in from the sun-filled windows. I tried on six different
looks, all of which I loved. If you want to see all the dresses, check out my article here for all the behind-the-scenes photos! If you are a bride and are looking at this new collection, check out my quiz to see which one might suit you best along with hair and makeup ideas.            </p>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
            My mom was such a trooper, taking some behind-the-scenes footage and photos as I tried on beautiful gowns. We walked from Natalie Rose Bridal to
Cibo for fish and chips and our first taste of New Zealand Pavlova!
Pavlova is my favorite dessert, and my mom makes a great version that I always request on my birthday or Christmas! My best friend‚Äôs dad made it when I was at her house as a teen, and I had to get him to give my mom the recipe. While we were used to a lot of fruit, which is typical on top of Pavlova, at this restaurant the salted caramel/peanut was the most popular, and we devoured it. Best. Dessert. Ever.            </p>

                Each evening brought new experiences. One of the highlights was the traditional Luau, where we immersed ourselves in Hawaiian culture with music, dance, and a feast featuring local specialties. The sunset views from the resort added a magical touch to our evening meals and activities.

            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                One of the top reasons to book a stay at Andaz Maui is to enjoy the pristine Mokapu and Wailea Beaches. Swimming in the crystal-clear, warm waters with breathtaking views was an unforgettable experience. We reveled in the sunshine on the soft, white sand and engaged in exciting water activities like paddle boarding, kayaking, and snorkeling. Discovering brightly colored fish and turtles near the shore was truly remarkable.

            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                As we soaked in the sun and enjoyed the outdoor activities at the Andaz Maui, we also recognized the broader conversations surrounding tourism in Hawaii. Traveling here has become a topic of ethical discussion due to its effects on the indigenous population and the environment. While the beauty and allure of Maui are undeniable, it is essential to consider these impacts as part of a responsible travel approach.
            </p>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                The Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort stands out for its commitment to environmental sustainability and cultural integration. Notably, the resort was constructed using 93% recycled materials and incorporates solar energy and electric equipment to minimize its carbon footprint. By supporting local wildlife preservation and showcasing local art, the resort contributes positively to the cultural and environmental stewardship of Maui.
            </p>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                Being mindful of these issues, it's crucial for visitors to choose accommodations and activities that support local communities and sustainable practices. Whether it‚Äôs participating in cultural programs, respecting sacred sites, or supporting local businesses, every small action contributes to a more ethical travel experience.
            </p>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                Thank you for joining me on this breathtaking escape to the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort. Lauren and I had a marvellous time soaking in the beauty and culture of Maui and a huge thank you to the Benefit Canada team for the gifted experience.
