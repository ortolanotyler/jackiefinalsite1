Waiheke is a must-see, my mom and I had such a great day exploring. I hope if youâ€™re traveling, I gave you some ideas on things to check out that are uniquely New Zealand, and I canâ€™t recommend Little & Friday and Cibo enough - of course, try Pavlova if you visit! I had a breakfast quiche, which was similar to a meat pie, but I kind of missed out and didnâ€™t try an iconic meat pie from New Zealand, so I will have to next time. ðŸ¤ž I hope you enjoy seeing what I got up to with my mom on this mother-daughter trip as well as some behind-the-scenes of my dress fitting!
Are you from New Zealand? I would love to know, and I would love to go back in the summer as well because it truly was a magical place. I felt like I fit right in with the lovely locals that I spoke to. I also noticed the fashion was pretty vibrant, especially in older ladies with funky earrings, glasses, and prints. I met some quite fabulous older ladies on this trip who were bold as ever!
Let me know below if you have any places that you think I should travel to next. Thanks for reading as always!
