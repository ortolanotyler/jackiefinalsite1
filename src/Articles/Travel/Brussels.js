<DropCap1 text="Welcome back to a sentimental travel post! This one’s all about
Tyler and my trip back to Belgium, where we first met back in
middle school! After our magical wedding in Sorrento, Italy
(you can read all about it here), we decided it was the perfect time for a full-
circle moment. So, we packed our bags and headed back to our childhood
homes, school campus, and some of Brussels’ hidden gems. Oh, and we even
squeezed in a dreamy day trip to Paris—because, why not?" />

</div>

     
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
      We stayed right in the heart of Brussels at Place Sainte-Catherine (or Sint-
Katelijneplein if you’re feeling fancy with your Dutch!). This square is
always buzzing with energy, famous for its seafood restaurants and proximity
to the beautiful Sainte Catherine Church. When we visited, the square had
these giant, colorful duck sculptures floating in the fountain—totally
Instagram-worthy! Sadly, we forgot to check if our hotel had air
conditioning, and let me tell you, Brussels was in full heatwave mode!
Lesson learned—always read those reviews carefully before you book. I now
like using Plannin.com to read reviews and won’t make that mistake again.
Heatwave or not, Brussels never disappoints. Here are a few gems you have
to check out if you’re planning a trip to this charming city</p>

</div>
    
      <h2 style={headingStyle}>Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert</h2>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
      One of the most stunning shopping spots in Brussels is the Galeries Royales
Saint-Hubert. You’ll find all the best chocolate shops here, like Leonidas,
Mary’s, and Neuhaus—it’s a chocolate lover’s dream! We enjoyed a delicious
croque-monsieur at Mokafé Brussel stijlvolle kussens, then wandered
through modern art galleries and gorgeous jewelry shops like Les Néréides
Paris.</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
The beautiful indoor arcade leads out to the bustling Rue des Bouchers,
where the shopping continues with tons more stores and an incredibly
lively atmosphere. It's the perfect place to soak in the Brussels vibe!</p>

</div>



      <h2 style={headingStyle}> Back to Our Old Neighbourhoods  </h2>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
      Since we both lived in Belgium, getting around felt second nature. We
hopped on buses, metros, and trains like pros! For tourists, I highly
recommend Belgium’s public transportation—it's clean, easy to navigate,
and takes you everywhere you need to go. We visited Tyler’s old home in
Watermael-Boitsfort and then headed to Stokkel Square, where I used to
live, just a couple of bus stops away at Willie St. Pierre.
</p>

<div style={gridContainerStyle}>
    <img src={image10} alt="Watermael-Boitsfort Belgium Art" style={imageStyle} /> 
</div>


    
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
      Stokkel Square is especially worth a visit! While much has stayed the same
since I lived there, the area has grown quite a bit. There are over 200 shops
now, like Caroll on Rue de Garennes, along with amazing restaurants lining
the streets. My family’s favorite spot was a cozy corner pub called Shake
Hands Pub, and we were obsessed with the pizza at La Barchetta. On this
trip, we tried a new restaurant called L’Harmony. Located in the heart of
Stockel, L'Harmony has quickly become one of the go-to spots in the area.
Just steps away from Place Dumon, this restaurant offers a delightful mix of
French-Belgian 'bistronomy'—a fusion of refined cuisine with the relaxed
atmosphere of a bistro. It ended up being one of the best meals of the trip!
Highly recommend giving it a try.

    <img src={image12} alt="Breakfast at an Italian Villa" style={imageStyle} /> 
</div>





 
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
      The most surreal part of Stokkel? As we were walking down my old street,
Rue Henrott, the current owner of my childhood home was parking in the
driveway—and she invited us in! It was wild to step back into my old house
after so many years.
</p>
<p style={paragraphStyle}>
      Visiting our old neighborhood felt like stepping into a time capsule. While
some things had changed, most of the stores and buildings were exactly the
same. I vividly remember seeing Twilight at the local cinema back in 2008,
and I’ll never forget going to ICI Paris XL to buy my first high-end lip gloss
from Smashbox (which I still own because I’m super sentimental). I was just
getting into makeup at the time, watching YouTubers, and already knew I
wanted to become one someday.

      <h2 style={headingStyle}>Best of Brussels</h2>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
      Anyways, let’s talk Brussels! We stopped by The Waffle Factory and shared a
very messy (but totally worth it) waffle in Grand-Place, which is easily one of
the most beautiful squares in the world. I couldn’t resist picking up some
Mary’s chocolates from the square—it’s the oldest and dreamiest chocolate
shop, with a history dating back to 1919. They had everything I adore: girly
floral packaging, sea-themed chocolates, and even special boxes with cat
designs! No wonder the Belgian royals love Mary’s, too
</p>

    <img src={image18} alt="Sorrento Souvenirs" style={imageStyle} />
</div>



<p style={paragraphStyle}>
For seafood lovers, Chez Léon is an absolute must. It’s the go-to spot for
classic Belgian seafood and brasserie-style dishes. We also couldn’t pass up a
stop at The Brothers, where they serve incredible burgers and fries with an
awesome view of Grand-Place. Tyler was in heaven with his plate of mussels!
If you're in the mood for a hearty breakfast and want something beyond the
typical European bread, cheese, and croissant combo, head over to Rue des
Bouchers and check out Lloyd Coffee Eatery. I had the most amazing
pancakes—perfect if you’re craving some comfort food, fresh juices or
salads.
</p>

<div style={gridContainerStyle}>
    <img src={image19} alt="Sorrento Souvenirs" style={imageStyle} /> 
    <img src={image20} alt="Sorrento Souvenirs" style={imageStyle} /> 
</div>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
Of course, no trip to Brussels is complete without visiting the iconic
Manneken Pis. There’s even a Manneken Pis museum where you can check
out all of his outfits! The little guy is so tiny but such a hilarious and famous
sculpture. You’ll also find tons of art around Brussels inspired by him.
Another beautiful spot we explored was Place du Petit Sablon, which we
visited on Belgian National Day. It’s a gorgeous little park surrounded by
elegant wrought-iron fencing and adorned with 48 statues representing
different ancient guilds of Brussels. The centrepiece is a stunning fountain
with statues of Belgian historical figures, making it a perfect place to relax,
people-watch, or just take in the peaceful atmosphere. The lush gardens and
intricate statues give the square a really charming, almost storybook-like
vibe!
</p>

<div style={gridContainerStyle}>

    <img src={image22} alt="Sorrento Souvenirs" style={imageStyle} /> 
</div>

      <h2 style={headingStyle}>International School of Brussels Visit (ISB)</h2>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
      What brought Tyler and me together back in 2007 was a pretty wild
coincidence—both of our parents landed work positions in Belgium! So,
Tyler moved from the U.S., and I moved from Canada, and we both ended
up attending the International School of Brussels (ISB). This school is not
only stunning but also super welcoming to alumni. We had the chance to
walk around the campus, snap some photos, and relive so many childhood
memories. It was like stepping back in time!
</p>

<div style={gridContainerStyle}>
    <img src={image23} alt="Sorrento Souvenirs" style={imageStyle} /> 
    <img src={image24} alt="Sorrento Souvenirs" style={imageStyle} /> 
    <img src={image25} alt="Sorrento Souvenirs" style={imageStyle} /> 
    <img src={image26} alt="Sorrento Souvenirs" style={imageStyle} /> 
    <img src={image27} alt="Sorrento Souvenirs" style={imageStyle} /> 
</div>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
I wonder if any of you reading this are fellow ISB alumni—if so, how
amazing is that school?! I still think back fondly on those epic school trips to
France, and of course, the cafeteria food was surprisingly good! ISB really
gave us such incredible experiences, and being back on campus was like the
ultimate nostalgia trip.
</p>


<h2 style={headingStyle}>Visit Neighbouring Countries by Train</h2>


<p style={paragraphStyle}>
What’s awesome about Belgium is its location—you can hop on a train and
easily visit neighbouring countries like Amsterdam and France. We took a
day trip to Paris, but it was quite the adventure since it was just a few days
before the 2024 Paris Olympics, and nearly every iconic street was blocked
off with heavily armed police prepping for the games
</p>

<div style={gridContainerStyle}>
    <img src={image28} alt="Sorrento Souvenirs" style={imageStyle} /> 
    <img src={image29} alt="Sorrento Souvenirs" style={imageStyle} /> 
    <img src={image30} alt="Sorrento Souvenirs" style={imageStyle} /> 
    <img src={image31} alt="Sorrento Souvenirs" style={imageStyle} /> 
</div>


<p style={paragraphStyle}>
Since we’ve been to Paris quite a few times and already seen all the major
sights, after walking forever to get close to the Eiffel Tower (and not getting
far), we decided to head to a quintessential Parisian neighbourhood: the 6th
Arrondissement near the Luxembourg Gardens. It was a more laid back
experience compared to visiting tourist hotspots like the Louvre, Notre-
Dame, and Champs-Élysées, and Tyler absolutely loved it. He’s already
saying that if we return to Paris, we need to stay in that area again.
</p>

<div style={gridContainerStyle}>
    <img src={image32} alt="Sorrento Souvenirs" style={imageStyle} /> 
    <img src={image33} alt="Sorrento Souvenirs" style={imageStyle} /> 

</div>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
A super girly and cute café we found was Fleur Café—it has the prettiest
toile-patterned dishes and amazing crêpes, which we enjoyed for lunch. The
Starbucks on Boulevard des Capucines is one of the most beautiful in the
world, with intricate chandeliers and a stunning, historic interior. We also
went shopping at Zara near the Palais Garnier Opera House—such a fun
spot to explore and I bought a chic cardigan.
 </p>

    <img src={image36} alt="Sorrento Souvenirs" style={imageStyle} /> 

</div>


<p style={paragraphStyle}>
After strolling through pigeon-lined streets and admiring the stunning
Haussmannian façades, we stayed at a tiny little boutique hotel called Hôtel
Saint-Germain, and I actually loved it! It was small but decorated in a funky
style, with a nice bathroom and a location that was both central and
affordable. </p>

We didn’t have a ton of time in Belgium or Paris, and it was a pretty low-key
trip, but I hope you enjoyed hearing about my recommendations! If you
have any of your own, be sure to leave them down below! Thanks for
reading, and if you want to see a Paris vlog where the streets weren’t actively
blocked off, check out my 2019 experience at Paris Fashion Week with
L’Oréal Paris. Definitely a more glamorous vlog!
