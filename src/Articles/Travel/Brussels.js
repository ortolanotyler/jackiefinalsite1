<DropCap1 text="Welcome back to a sentimental travel post! This oneâ€™s all about
Tyler and my trip back to Belgium, where we first met back in
middle school! After our magical wedding in Sorrento, Italy
(you can read all about it here), we decided it was the perfect time for a full-
circle moment. So, we packed our bags and headed back to our childhood
homes, school campus, and some of Brusselsâ€™ hidden gems. Oh, and we even
squeezed in a dreamy day trip to Parisâ€”because, why not?" />

</div>

     
<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  We stayed right in the heart of Brussels at Place Sainte-Catherine (or <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sint-Katelijneplein" style={linkStyle}>Sint-Katelijneplein</a> if youâ€™re feeling fancy with your Dutch!). This square is always buzzing with energy, famous for its <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g188644-d241355-Reviews-Sainte_Catherine_Church-Brussels.html" style={linkStyle}>seafood restaurants</a> and proximity to the beautiful <a href="https://www.brusselsmuseums.be/en/museums/sainte-catherine-church" style={linkStyle}>Sainte Catherine Church</a>. When we visited, the square had these giant, colorful duck sculptures floating in the fountainâ€”totally Instagram-worthy! Sadly, we forgot to check if our hotel had air conditioning, and let me tell you, Brussels was in full heatwave mode! Lesson learnedâ€”always read those reviews carefully before you book. I now like using <a href="https://plannin.com" style={linkStyle}>Plannin.com</a> to read reviews and wonâ€™t make that mistake again. Heatwave or not, Brussels never disappoints. Here are a few gems you have to check out if youâ€™re planning a trip to this charming city.

      <h2 style={headingStyle}>Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert</h2>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
  One of the most stunning shopping spots in Brussels is the <a href="https://www.galeriesroyales.be/" style={linkStyle}>Galeries Royales Saint-Hubert</a>. Youâ€™ll find all the best chocolate shops here, like <a href="https://www.leonidas.com/" style={linkStyle}>Leonidas</a>, <a href="https://www.marychoc.com/" style={linkStyle}>Maryâ€™s</a>, and <a href="https://www.neuhauschocolates.com/" style={linkStyle}>Neuhaus</a>â€”itâ€™s a chocolate loverâ€™s dream! We enjoyed a delicious croque-monsieur at <a href="https://mokafe.be/" style={linkStyle}>MokafÃ© Brussel stijlvolle kussens</a>, then wandered through modern art galleries and gorgeous jewelry shops like <a href="https://www.lesnereides.com/en/" style={linkStyle}>Les NÃ©rÃ©ides Paris</a>.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  The beautiful indoor arcade leads out to the bustling <a href="https://visit.brussels/en/place/Rue-des-Bouchers" style={linkStyle}>Rue des Bouchers</a>, where the shopping continues with tons more stores and an incredibly lively atmosphere. It's the perfect place to soak in the Brussels vibe!

      <h2 style={headingStyle}> Back to Our Old Neighbourhoods  </h2>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Since we both lived in Belgium, getting around felt second nature. We hopped on <a href="https://www.stib-mivb.be/index.htm?l=en" style={linkStyle}>buses, metros, and trains</a> like pros! For tourists, I highly recommend <a href="https://www.belgiantrain.be/en" style={linkStyle}>Belgiumâ€™s public transportation</a>â€”it's clean, easy to navigate, and takes you everywhere you need to go. We visited Tylerâ€™s old home in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watermael-Boitsfort" style={linkStyle}>Watermael-Boitsfort</a> and then headed to Stokkel Square, where I used to live, just a couple of bus stops away at Willie St. Pierre.
</p>

    <img src={image10} alt="Watermael-Boitsfort Belgium Art" style={imageStyle} /> 
</div>


    
<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Stokkel Square is especially worth a visit! While much has stayed the same since I lived there, the area has grown quite a bit. There are over 200 shops now, like <a href="https://www.caroll.com/en_be" style={linkStyle}>Caroll on Rue de Garennes</a>, along with amazing restaurants lining the streets. My familyâ€™s favorite spot was a cozy corner pub called Shake Hands Pub, and we were obsessed with the pizza at La Barchetta. On this trip, we tried a new restaurant called <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g188644-d13106293-Reviews-L_Harmony-Brussels.html" style={linkStyle}>Lâ€™Harmony</a>. Located in the heart of Stockel, L'Harmony has quickly become one of the go-to spots in the area. Just steps away from Place Dumon, this restaurant offers a delightful mix of French-Belgian 'bistronomy'â€”a fusion of refined cuisine with the relaxed atmosphere of a bistro. It ended up being one of the best meals of the trip! Highly recommend giving it a try.
</p>

   


<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  The most surreal part of Stokkel? As we were walking down my old street, Rue Henrott, the current owner of my childhood home was parking in the drivewayâ€”and she invited us in! It was wild to step back into my old house after so many years.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Visiting our old neighborhood felt like stepping into a time capsule. While some things had changed, most of the stores and buildings were exactly the same. I vividly remember seeing Twilight at the local cinema back in 2008, and Iâ€™ll never forget going to <a href="https://www.iciparisxl.be/" style={linkStyle}>ICI Paris XL</a> to buy my first high-end lip gloss from Smashbox (which I still own because Iâ€™m super sentimental). I was just getting into makeup at the time, watching YouTubers, and already knew I wanted to become one someday.

      <h2 style={headingStyle}>Best of Brussels</h2>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Anyways, letâ€™s talk Brussels! We stopped by <a href="https://wafflefactory.com/en/" style={linkStyle}>The Waffle Factory</a> and shared a very messy (but totally worth it) waffle in <a href="https://visit.brussels/en/place/Grand-Place" style={linkStyle}>Grand-Place</a>, which is easily one of the most beautiful squares in the world. I couldnâ€™t resist picking up some Maryâ€™s chocolates from the squareâ€”itâ€™s the oldest and dreamiest chocolate shop, with a history dating back to 1919. They had everything I adore: girly floral packaging, sea-themed chocolates, and even special boxes with cat designs! No wonder the Belgian royals love Maryâ€™s, too.
</p>

</div>



<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  For seafood lovers, <a href="https://chezleon.be/" style={linkStyle}>Chez LÃ©on</a> is an absolute must. Itâ€™s the go-to spot for classic Belgian seafood and brasserie-style dishes. We also couldnâ€™t pass up a stop at <a href="https://visit.brussels/en/place/The-Brothers" style={linkStyle}>The Brothers</a>, where they serve incredible burgers and fries with an awesome view of Grand-Place. Tyler was in heaven with his plate of mussels! If you're in the mood for a hearty breakfast and want something beyond the typical European bread, cheese, and croissant combo, head over to <a href="https://www.lloydcoffeeeatery.be/" style={linkStyle}>Rue des Bouchers</a> and check out <a href="https://www.lloydcoffeeeatery.be/" style={linkStyle}>Lloyd Coffee Eatery</a>. I had the most amazing pancakesâ€”perfect if youâ€™re craving some comfort food, fresh juices or salads.
</p>

</div>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Of course, no trip to Brussels is complete without visiting the iconic <a href="https://visit.brussels/en/place/Manneken-Pis" style={linkStyle}>Manneken Pis</a>. Thereâ€™s even a <a href="https://www.manekenpis.be/en/museum" style={linkStyle}>Manneken Pis museum</a> where you can check out all of his outfits! The little guy is so tiny but such a hilarious and famous sculpture. Youâ€™ll also find tons of art around Brussels inspired by him. Another beautiful spot we explored was <a href="https://visit.brussels/en/place/Place-du-Petit-Sablon" style={linkStyle}>Place du Petit Sablon</a>, which we visited on Belgian National Day. Itâ€™s a gorgeous little park surrounded by elegant wrought-iron fencing and adorned with 48 statues representing different ancient guilds of Brussels. The centrepiece is a stunning fountain with statues of Belgian historical figures, making it a perfect place to relax, people-watch, or just take in the peaceful atmosphere. The lush gardens and intricate statues give the square a really charming, almost storybook-like vibe!

      <h2 style={headingStyle}>International School of Brussels Visit (ISB)</h2>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
  What brought Tyler and me together back in 2007 was a pretty wild coincidenceâ€”both of our parents landed work positions in Belgium! So, Tyler moved from the U.S., and I moved from Canada, and we both ended up attending the <a href="https://www.isb.be/" style={linkStyle}>International School of Brussels (ISB)</a>. This school is not only stunning but also super welcoming to alumni. We had the chance to walk around the campus, snap some photos, and relive so many childhood memories. It was like stepping back in time!
</p>

<div style={gridContainerStyle}>
    <img src={image23} alt="Chateau International School of Brussels" style={imageStyle} /> 
    <img src={image24} alt="Pathway to middle school International

    <img src={image27} alt="Student Alumni Visiting Track at

</div>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  I wonder if any of you reading this are fellow ISB alumniâ€”if so, how amazing is that school?! I still think back fondly on those epic school trips to France, and of course, the cafeteria food was surprisingly good! ISB really gave us such incredible experiences, and being back on campus was like the ultimate nostalgia trip.
</p>



<h2 style={headingStyle}>Visit Neighbouring Countries by Train</h2>


<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Whatâ€™s awesome about Belgium is its locationâ€”you can hop on a train and easily visit neighbouring countries like <a href="https://www.iamsterdam.com/en" style={linkStyle}>Amsterdam</a> and France. We took a day trip to <a href="https://en.parisinfo.com/" style={linkStyle}>Paris</a>, but it was quite the adventure since it was just a few days before the 2024 Paris Olympics, and nearly every iconic street was blocked off with heavily armed police prepping for the games.
</p>

<div style={gridContainerStyle}>
    <img src={image28} alt="Exiting Train Station in Paris" style={imageStyle} />

    <img src={image30} alt="Cafe in Paris" style={imageStyle} /> 
    <img src={image31} alt="View of Eiffel Tower Paris France" style={imageStyle} /> 
</div>

  Since weâ€™ve been to Paris quite a few times and already seen all the major sights, after walking forever to get close to the Eiffel Tower (and not getting far), we decided to head to a quintessential Parisian neighbourhood: the <a href="https://en.parisinfo.com/paris-neighbourhoods/the-6th-arrondissement" style={linkStyle}>6th Arrondissement</a> near the <a href="https://en.parisinfo.com/paris-museum-monument/71482/Luxembourg-Gardens" style={linkStyle}>Luxembourg Gardens</a>. It was a more laid back experience compared to visiting tourist hotspots like the <a href="https://www.louvre.fr/en" style={linkStyle}>Louvre</a>, <a href="https://www.notredamedeparis.fr/en/" style={linkStyle}>Notre-Dame</a>, and <a href="https://en.parisinfo.com/paris-neighbourhoods/champs-elysees" style={linkStyle}>Champs-Ã‰lysÃ©es</a>, and Tyler absolutely loved it. Heâ€™s already saying that if we return to Paris, we need to stay in that area again.

  A super girly and cute cafÃ© we found was <a href="https://www.timeout.com/paris/restaurants/fleur-cafe" style={linkStyle}>Fleur CafÃ©</a>â€”it has the prettiest toile-patterned dishes and amazing crÃªpes, which we enjoyed for lunch. The <a href="https://en.parisinfo.com/shopping-paris/67394/Starbucks-Boulevard-des-Capucines" style={linkStyle}>Starbucks on Boulevard des Capucines</a> is one of the most beautiful in the world, with intricate chandeliers and a stunning, historic interior. We also went shopping at <a href="https://www.zara.com/fr/" style={linkStyle}>Zara near the Palais Garnier Opera House</a>â€”such a fun spot to explore and I bought a chic cardigan.

  After strolling through pigeon-lined streets and admiring the stunning <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haussmann%27s_renovation_of_Paris" style={linkStyle}>Haussmannian faÃ§ades</a>, we stayed at a tiny little boutique hotel called <a href="https://www.hotelstgermain.com/" style={linkStyle}>HÃ´tel Saint-Germain</a>, and I actually loved it! It was small but decorated in a funky style, with a nice bathroom and a location that was both central and affordable.

We didnâ€™t have a ton of time in Belgium or Paris, and it was a pretty low-key
trip, but I hope you enjoyed hearing about my recommendations! If you
have any of your own, be sure to leave them down below! Thanks for
reading, and if you want to see a Paris vlog where the streets werenâ€™t actively
blocked off, check out my 2019 experience at Paris Fashion Week with
Lâ€™OrÃ©al Paris. Definitely a more glamorous vlog!
