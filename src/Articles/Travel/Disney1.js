            <DropCap1 text="Welcome to Part One of my magical recap of an unforgettable time at Walt Disney World, FL in 2023. My best friend Lauren and I chose Disney's Beach Club Resort for our stay, marking her first visit and my first return since 2002. This article focuses on our resort experience, offering a glimpse into the luxury and leisure that awaited us at this colonial resort and why we chose to book!" />

            <h2 style={headingStyle}>🌟 First Impression: Beach Club Resort</h2>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                Driving in from Saint Augustine, Florida we were immediately captivated by the Beach Club Resort's charm, reminiscent of a New England dream. This deluxe resort, inspired by 1800s beach cottages, has amenities such as the Storm-Along Bay Water Park, the convenient Beach Club Marketplace, and the nostalgic Beaches & Cream Soda Shop, making it the perfect base for our Disney adventures.
            </p>
            <h2 style={headingStyle}>💵 Cost Considerations: Weighing the Pros and Cons</h2>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                This resort is a deluxe option, so it comes with a higher price tag. Check prices as it fluctuates greatly depending on the time of year from between 390 USD up to 990 USD😳 a night.
            </p>

            </div>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                When browsing the various resorts, the Beach Club’s design caught my eye. While I'm all for a fun and goofy Disney experience, I wanted to stay somewhere elegant as an adult. The light blue building, adorned with beautiful Victorian trim, the gardens with pops of bright pink flowers, and a view of the boardwalk offered something truly magical to wake up to.
            </p>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                We chose a <strong>standard room with a garden view,</strong> and although the rooms' interior decor slightly paled in comparison to the exterior's enchantment, the Disney-themed touches and the overall nostalgic beach vibe more than compensated for it, in my opinion. The Mickey ears towel display and Disney-themed toiletries were exciting for us to see!
            </p>
            <h2 style={headingStyle}>🏝 Diverse Room Options for Every Guest</h2>
            <img src={beachclub1} alt='Beach Club Room' style={imageStyle} />
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                For larger families or those seeking extra comfort, expansive Suites have separate living areas. You can choose Garden, Woods or Water View Rooms.
            </p>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                For the price tag, I’ve seen several complaints about being disappointed by the interior decor. However, I feel it still captures a nostalgic beach vibe, and I doubt you’ll spend too much time in the room with all there is to do! The other resort we considered but was out of our budget was the Polynesian Village Resort. This may be a better option for you if the room theme matters a lot for your experience, it features a tropical aesthetic rather than a beach cottage.

            <h2 style={headingStyle}>🛥 Unique Amenities and Shared Experiences with Yacht Club</h2>
            <img src={beachclub2} alt='Yacht Club' style={imageStyle} />
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                Adjacent to the Beach Club is the Yacht Club, where we explored additional dining and shopping options as the resorts share amenities. If you are staying at Disney's Beach Club Resort or the Yacht Club Resort, the top dining options to check out are the Beaches & Cream Soda Shop, famous for its "Kitchen Sink" sundae, and the Yachtsman Steakhouse, known for premium steaks and seafood in a New England yacht club atmosphere. Cape May Café and Ale & Compass Restaurant also offer memorable dining experiences with character breakfasts and New England-inspired menus.
            </p>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                There are also different souvenirs at the Beach Club Marketplace and The Market at Ale & Compass at the Yacht Club, offering everyday essentials, souvenirs, drinks and snacks. Both are great to check out before deciding on your souvenirs!
            </p>
            <img src={beachclub3} alt='Beach Club Marketplace' style={imageStyle} />
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                The Beach and Yacht Club resorts both offer activities like movies under the stars, tennis, volleyball, campfires, and different watercraft rentals for enjoyment on Crescent Lake. You can also enjoy state-of-the-art fitness centres and book spa services for relaxation.

            <h2 style={headingStyle}>🍹 Storm-Along Bay Pool, Hurricane Hannah’s Waterside Bar & Grill</h2>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                A bit about my personal experience, upon check-in, Lauren and I grabbed a quick bite at the Ale & Compass Lounge (great appetizers, fries and burgers) and dedicated our first day to enjoying Storm-Along Bay.
            </p>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                This expansive pool, spanning 3 acres, features a sandy bottom, a lazy river, a striking white windmill, and a waterslide attached to a life-size shipwreck on the beach. Since there were so many kids swimming, I didn’t take great pictures of the pool - but you can check it out in detail on the booking site here.
            </p>
            <img src={beachclub4} alt='Storm-Along Bay Pool' style={imageStyle} />
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                After relaxing poolside, we ventured to Hurricane Hannah's Waterside Bar & Grill for drinks. The bar is a little shack, similar to Rico’s Surf Shop in Hannah Montana with a laid-back vibe.
            </p>
            <img src={beachclub5} alt='Hurricane Hannah’s' style={imageStyle} />
            <h2 style={headingStyle}>🌴 The Beach & Boardwalk Nearby</h2>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                Our evening continued with a leisurely walk along the beach, where we enjoyed the sunset from swings and strolled down the lively Disney BoardWalk. The charming waterfront boardwalk is brimming with restaurants, night performers and gift shops, offering a vibrant atmosphere at night that appeals to both adults and children.

            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                As someone who's a bit of a lightweight, my single drink at the bar led to a somewhat clumsy walk around the entire village and… blurry pictures I shall not include😂 ! We toyed with the idea of catching a movie under the stars, a feature the resort offers, but ultimately decided to head to bed early to conserve energy for the extensive walking we anticipated at Epcot the next day.
            </p>
            <h2 style={headingStyle}>🗺 Effortless Park Access and Transportation Tips</h2>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                Speaking of Epcot, it is only a 5-10 minute walk from the resort. If Epcot is on your park bucket list (and it should be!!!) all the more reason to stay at the Beach Club resort. You can also take a quick boat ride to the park.
            </p>
            <img src={beachclub6} alt='Epcot Access' style={imageStyle} />
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                For Hollywood Studios (the second closest park) you can walk along a scenic path that takes about 15 to 20 minutes. There's also boat service available from the resort's dock, providing a relaxing journey to the park's entrance.
            </p>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                If you want to ride the epic skyline, walk to Epcot where the International Gateway Station is located. The Skyliner provides transportation to Disney's Hollywood Studios, Disney’s Riviera Resort, Disney's Caribbean Beach Resort.
            </p>

</div>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                If you are interested in other parks, like Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom, you can easily get there by catching a bus out front of the resort. Read the best of Epcot, Magic Kingdom and Animal Kingdom in a separate blog post, here.
            </p>
            <h2 style={headingStyle}>🍦 A Final Dessert at Beaches & Cream Soda Shop</h2>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                Our last day at the Beach Club Resort was bittersweet, with leisurely walks along the boardwalk, and a final, decadent sundae at the famous Beaches & Cream Soda Shop.
            </p>
            <img src={beachclub8} alt='Beaches & Cream Soda Shop' style={imageStyle} />
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                The ice cream shop is often booked up if you don’t reserve a table in advance, but luckily there is a window shop where you can get many of the items without a long wait time. The ice cream isn’t the richest, creamiest of all time (it’s no Häagen-Dazs) but it is beautifully presented and a very fun experience, no matter the age. I mean….look at the size of the sundae! 🍒
            </p>
            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                I bought an Angel plushy from the Boardwalk shops and headed home! Keep reading for a quick nautical resort comparison to help you decide on your stay.

                    <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                        If you enjoy a nautical theme, you may be choosing between the Beach Club, Yacht Club, and Disney’s Polynesian Village Resort.
                    </p>
                    <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                        I say go with Beach Club between The Yacht and Beach Club Resort simply because of the shared amenities. While Yacht Club is slightly more sophisticated, the light blue and white stands out and feels more enchanting!
                    </p>
                    <p style={paragraphStyle}>
                        For those drawn to the serene allure of the tropics, Disney's Polynesian Village Resort transports guests to a South Pacific paradise, complete with monorail access to the parks and celebrated dining experiences like 'Ohana. It is for sure on my bucket list to stay at the Polynesian resort in the future!

                Note about accessibility: Disney's Beach Club Resort is fully accessible to guests with disabilities, offering features like accessible rooms with widened doors and roll-in showers, visual alarm devices for hearing disabilities, wheelchair-accessible pathways, and service animal accommodations. Complimentary Disney transportation is equipped to accommodate guests with disabilities, and the resort provides lifts for pool access, ensuring a comfortable and enjoyable stay for everyone. This is another wonderful quality about Disney World, it really has everyone in mind to enjoy the magic!
