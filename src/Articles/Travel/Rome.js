<DropCap1 text="Welcome back to another travel article! This time, it's all about our whirlwind 72 hours in Rome, the first stop on our European adventure before heading to Sorrento, Italy, for our wedding! Tyler and I had visited Rome when we were younger, but experiencing such a romantic city together as adults was beyond exciting. Over the course of three days, we explored iconic landmarks like the Vatican, the Trevi Fountain, and the Colosseum, indulged in mouthwatering Italian cuisine, and soaked in the vibrant atmosphere of Rome’s charming neighbourhoods.

    <div style={gridContainerStyle}>
    <img src={image1} alt="Jackie Wyers Arrival at Unica Suites in Rome - Iconic Architecture" style={imageStyle} loading="lazy" />  
</div>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  After flying from <a href="https://www.toronto.ca/" style={linkStyle}>Toronto</a> to <a href="https://www.rome.net/" style={linkStyle}>Rome</a>, we managed to carry our six pieces of luggage, including a massive wedding dress, through airports and city streets, arriving at our charming hotel, Unica Suites. Driving into Rome feels like stepping into a dream, with stunning <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/rome" style={linkStyle}>architecture</a> greeting you at every turn.

<div style = {{ margin : '1rem auto'}}>

</div>


<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Unica Suites was the perfect choice for us. The rooms were clean, well-equipped with excellent air conditioning, and featured modern bathrooms. We were thrilled with the great view, all at a reasonable price. The building itself exuded old-world charm, though the elevator was a bit tricky. If the doors weren’t closed properly, you’d have to use the stairs, which can be challenging if you’re lugging suitcases. I’d recommend a different hotel if you have a lot of luggage, but for backpackers, this is a solid option. The location is unbeatable—just a short walk from the 
  <a href="https://www.italyguides.it" style={linkStyle}>Spanish Steps</a>, Barberini Metro Station, and the <a href="https://www.rome.net/trevi-fountain" style={linkStyle}>Trevi Fountain</a>.

    <h2 style={headingStyle}>Day 1: Exploring Rome 🍝</h2>
    <p style={paragraphStyle}>
      After freshening up at the hotel, we strolled down the charming Barberini streets and hopped on the Barberini Metro to try Bonci Pizzarium. This gourmet pizza by the slice, known as "pizza al taglio," is a must-try for pizza lovers, offering a variety of fresh, creative toppings—perfect for a quick snack on the go. Harsh opinion alert: Tyler and I both agree that New York pizza might have Rome beat, though the pasta in Italy definitely takes the cake!

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  We then rushed over to the <a href="https://m.museivaticani.va/content/museivaticani-mobile/en.html" style={linkStyle}>Vatican Museums</a>, arriving just as they were closing, which turned out to be a blessing as the lines were super short. If you're visiting the Vatican, don’t be swayed by the many tourists giving out misinformation around the entrance—always ask a staff member if you're unsure where to go. Despite what others might say, stick to the line you’re directed to by staff so you can enter the beauty of <a href="https://www.vaticanstate.va/en/" style={linkStyle}>Vatican City</a> without confusion. The signs are straightforward, but for some reason, people seem to get it twisted! 🤣

</div>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Did you know that <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Vatican-City" style={linkStyle}>Vatican City</a> is technically a separate country? Inside, you’ll find the most incredible artwork and sculptures, including masterpieces by <a href="https://www.michelangelo.org/" style={linkStyle}>Michelangelo</a>, especially in the Sistine Chapel. I’m glad I experienced Vatican City—its art is truly angelic—but I think I would have felt overwhelmed during the day when it can get quite crowded. If you don’t like feeling like sardines in the summer heat, I’d recommend going later in the day when it’s starting to clear out.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <span style={{ fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Dress Code Faux Pas:</span> I wore a little red dress that showed both my knees and shoulders, which, in hindsight, wasn’t the best choice. While no one gave me strange looks and I wasn’t denied entry, I was asked to cover my shoulders with a shawl before entering the <a href="https://www.sistinechapel.info/" style={linkStyle}>Sistine Chapel</a>. The staff were really kind about it, but I’ve heard stories of people being turned away for not dressing modestly or even scolded by nuns! It’s better to be prepared. Modesty is expected due to the religious significance of the site.

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Despite my dress code mishap, I adore the photos we took—especially the one with the stunning light streaming through the windows against the intricate painted ceilings. While I wouldn’t recommend my outfit choice, remember that mistakes happen, and don’t let it ruin your experience if you make an error like I did. I call it my Vatican-slay look—maybe controversial, but hey, what can you do other than laugh and move on? 🤭
</p>
<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  After leaving the Vatican, we cooled down with lemon gelato and strolled through <a href="https://www.rome.net/st-peters-square" style={linkStyle}>St. Peter's Square</a> to admire its magnificence before heading to dinner at Osteria del Commari. This cozy, traditional Roman osteria was the perfect spot to unwind after a busy day. I loved my spicy <a href="https://www.tasteatlas.com/pasta-allarrabbiata" style={linkStyle}>Pasta all’arrabbiata</a>, and Tyler enjoyed a classic <a href="https://www.tasteatlas.com/cacio-e-pepe" style={linkStyle}>cacio e pepe</a>. If you enjoy cacio e pepe and are visiting different regions in Italy, be sure to try it in Rome! It isn’t as prominently featured on menus in places like Sorrento, where the focus is more on the local specialties of the <a href="https://www.italyguides.it/en/campania" style={linkStyle}>Campania region</a>. After dinner, we took the metro back to our hotel and got a well-deserved rest.

<h2 style={headingStyle}>Day 2: Sunrise at the Trevi Fountain & Exploring Rome ⛲</h2>
<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  We started our second day in Rome bright and early, waking up at 6:00 AM to visit the <a href="https://www.rome.net/trevi-fountain" style={linkStyle}>Trevi Fountain</a> at sunrise. This is the best time to go if you want to avoid the crowds and capture some stunning photos. The Trevi Fountain is not only a stunning piece of Baroque architecture but also steeped in tradition. Legend has it that if you toss a coin into the fountain over your left shoulder, you are destined to return to Rome. Naturally, we made our wishes and got a fantastic photo with the help of a fabulous Instagram mom who knew just how to frame the shot. A queen!

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Since it was so early, our café options were limited, so we ended up at <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.com/it/it-it/mccafe.html" style={linkStyle}>McCafé</a>. It’s always fun to see what’s different at McDonald’s in various countries—I tried a cornetto filled with pistachio cream, and it was delicious!
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Beat Jet Lag: Traveling to Rome means walking thousands of steps per day, which can be tough with jet lag. After our early morning at the Trevi Fountain, we took a long nap, which helped us adjust to Italy time and stay up late without feeling overtired.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Funny enough, as we walked past the Trevi Fountain later that day, I ran into a follower—it was such a lovely experience! We also discovered a fun little store filled with rubber ducks, perfect for a quirky souvenir.

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Next, we walked to the <a href="https://www.rome.net/pantheon" style={linkStyle}>Pantheon</a>, one of the best-preserved monuments from ancient Rome. This iconic structure, originally built as a temple to all the gods of ancient Rome, is famous for its massive dome and the oculus at its centre, which allows natural light to illuminate the building’s interior. The Pantheon is a true architectural marvel and a must-see for history buffs and art lovers alike.

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  We then enjoyed a late lunch at Osteria da Fortunata. Yes, it’s a bit touristy, but the food is fantastic, and watching the pasta being made fresh in the window is a treat. The vintage lemonade was one of my favorite parts of the meal—‘50s makeup goals!

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  After lunch, we headed to the vibrant <a href="https://www.lonelyplanet.com/italy/rome/trastevere" style={linkStyle}>Trastevere neighbourhood</a>, crossing the Ponte Sisto bridge. This area is known for its lively atmosphere, with street musicians, love locks on the bridge, authentic Roman cuisine, and artisanal gelato shops along the Roman streets. Think charming alleys, quaint trattorias, and beautiful churches like <a href="https://www.rome.net/santa-maria-in-trastevere" style={linkStyle}>Santa Maria in Trastevere</a>. We wandered through vintage shops and soaked in the local vibes. Trastevere is also famous for its thriving nightlife, with countless bars, cafés, and restaurants where locals and tourists alike gather to enjoy the evening.

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  We ended the day with a stop at the <a href="https://www.rome.net/colosseum" style={linkStyle}>Colosseum</a> to admire its grandeur as the sun set, while a live violinist played in the background—truly a magical moment. The ruins, lined with statues of prominent figures from the past, were a history buff’s dream. Tyler loved it! The Colosseum, once the site of gladiatorial combat and public spectacles, is an enduring symbol of the Roman Empire’s might and architectural genius.

  We topped off the evening with another gelato and climbed the <a href="https://www.italyguides.it/en/lazio/rome/spanish-steps" style={linkStyle}>Spanish Steps</a>. There’s a bar at the top where we had a drink and enjoyed the city views before heading back to our hotel.

<h2 style={headingStyle}>Day 3: Souvenir Shopping & Farewell Rome</h2>
<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  On our last day in Rome, we took it easy, wandering around to pick up souvenirs. I always wait until the last day to make sure I’m confident in my purchases. I found adorable party favours for the wedding, like little limoncello bottles and lemon candies, at a store called Limon’e. While the store was super fun, I later discovered that similar items were much cheaper in <a href="https://www.rome.net/sorrento" style={linkStyle}>Sorrento</a>, so if you’re traveling to multiple destinations in Italy, keep that in mind!

  Some classic souvenirs from Rome include leather goods, handmade sandals, Murano glass (originating from Venice but found in Rome as well), and beautiful postcards—perfect for journaling. If you’re into quirky finds, there’s a shop full of rubber ducks near the Trevi Fountain that’s worth a visit! Luckily, I waited to purchase leather goods in Sorrento!

My Rome Souvenirs
</p>
<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  After one last stroll around the city, we capped off our Roman adventure by taking a taxi to the train station. From there, we hopped on a train to <a href="https://www.naples.com/" style={linkStyle}>Naples</a>. If you’re looking to splurge on a souvenir, there’s a <a href="https://www.bricstore.com/" style={linkStyle}>Bricks Milano</a> store at the Naples terminal for gorgeous leather luggage, but I decided to save it for another trip.

    <p style={paragraphStyle}>
  We took a cab to the ferry and made our way to the breathtaking shores of Sorrento. Cab drivers may pressure you into taking them the whole way, but I recommend sticking to the ferry—it’s cheaper and offers stunning views as you approach Sorrento. The driving in Naples is nuts!

  If you’re visiting Rome, take the time to slow down and truly savour the experience—there’s so much beauty, incredible <a href="https://www.tasteatlas.com/italian-cuisine" style={linkStyle}>Italian food</a>, and while it’s undeniably touristy, the vibes are amazing. People from all over the world are sharing in the joy of what, for many, is a once-in-a-lifetime trip. Be sure to toss a coin into the fountain to come back again! The love in the air is palpable, and we found that people were always happy to offer to take a photo of Tyler and me, and we gladly returned the favour. Rome is filled with smiles and good vibes.
