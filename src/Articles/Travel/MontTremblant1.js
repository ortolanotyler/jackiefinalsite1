            <h2 style={headingStyle}>üèî Arriving at Mont Tremblant</h2>
           
            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >
                Mont Tremblant welcomed us with a picturesque landscape straight out of a postcard as we drove up to our hotel. Staying at the stunning   <a href='/hotelq' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                Hotel Quintessence 

                </a> set the tone for a trip that promised luxury, relaxation, and adventure rolled into one. From the moment we entered our room, complete with a cozy fireplace and breathtaking views, we knew we were in for a treat.
            </p>

            <img src={tremblant1} alt="Qu√©b√©coise Pizza" style={{ width: '100%' }} />


            <h2 style={headingStyle}>üç¥ Try the Qu√©b√©coise Pizza</h2>
         
            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >

                While Mont Tremblant's Pedestrian Village is a festive spot brimming with dining options, it somewhat resembles Disney World in that the sheer volume of patrons means the food might not always be served perfectly hot or live up to the expectations set by its price. However, there are definitely standout eateries worth visiting. One such place we tried was "Le Vieux Four," renowned for its Qu√©b√©coise pizza. This pizza, topped with tomato sauce, pepperoni, mushrooms, cheese, and green peppers, earned the 4th spot among the Top 5 Best Pizzas in Mont Tremblant. The restaurant is celebrated for its wood-fired oven, which turns out exquisite, thin-crust pizzas.
            </p>
            <img src={tremblant2} alt="Qu√©b√©coise Pizza" style={{ width: '100%' }} />

            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >
                Opting for takeout allowed us to enjoy this delicious pizza in the comfort of our luxury room by the fireplace and enjoy an afternoon jacuzzi. Dining in at the restaurant promises a great experience as well.

            <h2 style={headingStyle}>üó∫ Exploring Mont-Tremblant‚Äôs Pedestrian Village</h2>
            <img src={tremblant3} alt="Mont-Tremblant Pedestrian Village" style={{ width: '100%' }} />
            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >
                After a morning Nespresso, we headed to explore Mont-Tremblant‚Äôs Pedestrian Village in style. Nestled in the heart of Quebec's Laurentian Mountains, Mont Tremblant's Pedestrian Village is a picturesque and vibrant town that offers a unique blend of natural beauty and quaint European charm. This bustling village is a haven for visitors year-round, with its cobblestone streets lined with an eclectic mix of shops and boutiques that cater to all tastes and interests.
            </p>
            <img src={tremblant4} alt="Mont Tremblant ski village" style={{ width: '100%' }} />

            <h2 style={headingStyle}>ü§§ La Maison de la Cr√™pe</h2>

            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >
                Among the must-visit food spots, if you love a good crepe, try La Cr√™perie - La Maison de la Cr√™pe. This cozy restaurant offers gourmet crepes with sweet and savory fillings served in a charming, rustic setting just below the ski slopes. I ordered Matante Claudette, and it was the best chicken crepe Tyler and I have had!
            </p>
            <img src={tremblant5} alt="La Maison de la Cr√™pe" style={{ width: '100%' }} />
         
            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >
            Looking for more of a treat? ‚ÄùLa Chocolaterie de la Gare" is a paradise for
those with a sweet tooth, offering handmade chocolates and decadent treats
that capture the essence of Quebecois craftsmanship.
            </p>
<h2 style={headingStyle}>ü¶´ Roots Store Mont Tremblant</h2>

<p style={ paragraphStyle} >
    
My personal favorite for fashion, "Roots Store Mont Tremblant," not only
carries the latest from Roots but also features exclusive items and limitededition
collections that celebrate Mont Tremblant's heritage. These unique
souvenirs are not available in other Roots locations. Since it was almost
spring, I chose a little beaver plushie in a Roots hoodie instead of a hoodie
for myself, but you really can't go wrong with this iconic Canadian brand.
</p>

<p style={ paragraphStyle} >
These shops, among others, make the Pedestrian Village not just a
destination but a journey through the culture, style, and flavours of Mont
Tremblant. We used this time to explore and observe all the ski and
snowboarders in their gear, cruising down the slopes. Made us even more
excited to gear up for our ski day!

            <h2 style={headingStyle}>üå≤ Gondala Ride</h2>
            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >
                Be sure to experience the complimentary Gondola Ride at Mont Tremblant, which descends to the village's base ‚Äî no ski lift ticket required for this journey. It offers a mesmerizing experience with breathtaking panoramic views of the Laurentian Mountains, the village's uniquely colorful buildings, and Quebec's lush landscapes. Each season transforms the ride into a distinct visual spectacle: the verdant greens of summer, autumn's fiery palette, winter's pristine snowscapes, and the fresh blooms of spring.

            <h2 style={headingStyle}>üçÅ Syrup On Snow</h2>
            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >
                At the base of the village, you'll find ‚ÄúCabane √† Sucre,‚Äù offering Maple Syrup on snow for $3 CAD. It's somewhat of a sticky affair but undoubtedly an enjoyable experience. ‚ÄúPlace Bon Bon‚Äù is a fun candy shop also in the area, especially for kids!

            <img src={tremblant8} alt="Syrup on Snow" style={{ width: '100%' }} />

            <h2 style={headingStyle}>‚ùÑ Skiing in Mont-Tremblant</h2>
            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >
                Let's dive into skiing! My parents introduced me to skiing around the age of 4, and it became a staple activity throughout my childhood and teenage years. I felt a bit nervous since I hadn't skied in 10 years, but surprisingly, it all came back to me during the first green run. Tyler, however, approached skiing with much more confidence despite having only skied twice before! He proved to be somewhat of a hazard on the slopes but thoroughly enjoyed the experience. It looks like skiing will become a more regular adventure for us next winter!
            </p>

            <h2 style={headingStyle}>üéø Ski/Snowboard Rental Process</h2>
            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >
                Renting skis at Mont Tremblant is an incredibly straightforward process, and we were hitting the slopes in no time! Here's a step-by-step guide to streamline your ski rental experience during your visit. Online reservation: Many rental shops offer the convenience of reserving your equipment online ahead of time. This was a game-changer for us; our gear was ready to go upon arrival. While you might find slightly better deals in town like Ski Max, for short visits like ours, picking up skis near the Telecabine Express lift saves time, allowing you to quickly get on  your first ride.

            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >
                Rental Package: Typically, rental packages include skis, boots, poles, and helmets. Goggles are not provided, and trust me, you'll want them to protect against the glare of the sun and snow. Bringing your own goggles can enhance your skiing experience, especially if you have sensitive eyes.  shops that offer performance or demo rentals.
            </p>

            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >
            High-End Equipment: If you're in search of premium gear, look for shops
that offer performance or demo rentals.
            </p>



            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >
                Fitting & Pick Up: At the rental shop, staff will help you select boots and skis in the sizes that suit you best. Your ski length will be determined by your height, weight, and skiing proficiency. Once fitted, you're all set to hit the slopes.
            </p>

            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >
                Return Policy: It's important to understand the return policy. Typically, equipment must be returned by the end of your rental period, which usually means by closing time on the day of rental or the following morning. Be mindful of late return fees. Additionally, when you take a break and leave your skis or board unattended, use a lock or keep them in sight. Despite the wishful thinking that theft won't happen, it's better to be safe and avoid potential charges for lost equipment.

            <h2 style={headingStyle}>‚õ∑ Most Loved Slopes</h2>
            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >
                A bit about the slopes, there are 4 main areas. Mont Tremblant's South Side buzzes with life, offering trails for all levels amid a lively village, while the North Side promises tranquility and challenges for the seasoned. The Soleil Side delights with its sunny, gentle slopes perfect for beginners, whereas The Edge caters to the adventurous with secluded glade skiing for a backcountry experience.
            </p>

            <img src={tremblant11} alt="Mont Tremblant Skila" style={{ width: '100%' }} />

            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >
            üíö La Nansen: One of the longest runs at Mont Tremblant, stretching over 6
km from the summit to the base on the North Side. It's a green run, making
it accessible for beginners, but its length and scenic views are enjoyed by all
levels. Tyler & I went down La Nansen several times!
            </p>

            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >
            üíô Le Tunnel: An intermediate slope on the South Side known for its
unique feature‚Äîa tunnel that skiers and snowboarders pass through. It's a
favorite for its novelty and the fun experience it provides.
            </p>

            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >

            üñ§ üñ§ Dynamite: Recognized as the steepest run at Mont Tremblant,
located on the North Side. This double-black diamond trail is a thrillseeker's
dream and is loved by advanced skiers and snowboarders for its
challenge and steepness. We did not touch this one üò¨
            </p>

            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >

üñ§ Expo: A popular black diamond run on the South Side that offers a
good mix of speed and technicality. It's well-loved by experienced skiers
looking for a challenge without venturing into double-black diamond
territory. 
</p>

<p style={ paragraphStyle} >
            üíö La P'tit Bonheur: A gentle green run on the Soleil Side, perfect for
beginners and families. Its easy terrain and sunny disposition make it a
favorite for those new to the sport or looking to enjoy a leisurely ski.

            </p>





            <h2 style={headingStyle}>‚òï Apr√®s Ski</h2>

            <p style={ paragraphStyle} >
            Need a quick break for lunch? We stopped at La Forge Bar & Grill for a
quick bite outside with view of the mountain slopes, sharing a salad and
some sweet potato fries. My favorite cafe was the Bistro Au Grain de Caf√©. I
loved this cafe so much, the Croissants aux Amandes aka Almond Croissant
was delicious and the eclectic atmosphere. While poutine isn‚Äôt my personal
favorite, there are poutine joints around and the iconic Canadian Beaver Tail
treats!            </p>

             <p style={ paragraphStyle} >

             On a final note, I wanted to mention another affordable bed & breakfast
where we stayed, slightly farther from the slopes but offering a pleasant
experience. Le  <a href = "https://www.900tremblant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
900 Tremblant Couette * Caf√© * Bistro 
</a> is newly renovated,
and the owner is very welcoming. Although the rooms are on the smaller
side and the bathrooms are just adequate, the food and common areas are
fantastic. We particularly enjoyed the cafe, making it a delightful spot to visit
even if you're not staying overnight. Truly, it's an excellent deal considering
the location.
            </p>
