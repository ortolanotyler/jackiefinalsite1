üåü First Impressions and Ambiance
Upon arrival at the Prince of Wales Hotel, we were immediately captivated
by its Victorian charm. The grand entrance, adorned with ornate floral
wallpapers, antique furnishings, and sculptures, transported us into an era
of refined elegance. Additional touches like stained glass windows further
enhanced the luxurious ambiance. The hotel‚Äôs hanging flowers and lush
bushes, set against the charming streets of Niagara-on-the-Lake, offered a
stunning sight, perfect for roaming this romantic town.
üíµ Cost Considerations: Pros and Cons
Staying at the upscale Prince of Wales Hotel comes with a higher price tag,
particularly during peak summer season when Niagara-On-The-Lake draws
the most visitors. During our stay, room rates ranged from about $250 to
$450 CAD per night, depending on the room type and the timing of the
visit.
While this may seem steep, we felt the cost was thoroughly justified by the
hotel‚Äôs exceptional service, luxurious atmosphere, and unparalleled location
in the heart of Niagara-On-The-Lake.
We chose a Premium King Room which is beautifully decorated with
thoughtful details but somewhat compact. The air conditioning unit tends to
be noisy and may not effectively cool the room during particularly hot
weather. Nonetheless, the room's elegant charm and the hotel's excellent
location significantly outweigh these minor drawbacks. Plus, a hand
delivered rose was a beautiful touch from the staff!
ü•Ä Room Options and Accommodations
The Prince of Wales Hotel offers a diverse array of guest rooms and suites,
each richly decorated with Victorian charm and modern amenities. Options
range from Traditional and Superior Guest Rooms‚Äîideal for couples or
small groups, to Deluxe Rooms with added space and luxury features such
as fireplaces. For the ultimate experience, Premium Guest Rooms and the
lavish Royal Suite provide deluxe comforts like gas fireplaces, jetted baths,
and exquisite Wine Themed Cellar Suites, ensuring a stay that blends
historical elegance with contemporary luxury.
ü´ñ High Tea at the Prince of Wales Hotel
The Prince of Wales Hotel offers a quintessentially elegant high tea
experience that, regrettably, I didn‚Äôt get to try during my stay! Hosted in the
hotel's charming drawing room, this experience includes a selection of
finely crafted tea blends accompanied by an assortment of traditional
scones, pastries, and delicate finger sandwiches. Noble Restaurant,
Churchill Lounge, Charcuterie & Panini Bar are also in-hotel options for
food.
