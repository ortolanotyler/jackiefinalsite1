Welcome back as we reminisce about the stunning Andaz Maui
at Wailea Resort in Hawaii. This trip not only showcased
pristine beaches and exquisite hotel amenities but also created
unforgettable memories with my best friend Lauren and the amazing team
from Benefit Cosmetics Canada.

üå¥ First Impressions and Ambiance

Upon our arrival at the Andaz Maui, the breathtaking views of Wailea‚Äôs
shores captivated us instantly. The resort's open, airy design with its lush
landscapes and modern touches perfectly blends luxury with the natural
beauty of Maui. Every corner of the resort promised a photo opportunity,
with its infinity pools merging into the ocean horizon.


üè® Room and Comfort: Living the Suite Life

Our room at the Andaz Maui was a cozy haven of tranquility. The balcony
was the best part of our standard room, with panoramic views of the whole
resort and Pacific Ocean as pictured above. The room featured minimalist
decor and the Benefit Canada team decorated with amazing swag! Lauren &
I were so excited to say the least.



üåû Room Options and Accessibility


In terms of accommodations, the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort offers a
variety of choices. Lauren and I enjoyed the comfort of a standard guest
room which boasted stunning ocean and pool views from a spacious
balcony. (We brought Scrump from Lily & Stitch along for the trip üòÜ )
For those seeking more space and luxury, the resort also offers expansive
suites equipped with additional living areas and enhanced amenities. Private
villas are available for guests who desire ultimate privacy and exclusivity,
complete with personalized services.

The property includes ADA-compliant rooms equipped with features such
as roll-in showers, lowered storage solutions, and other assistive devices
upon request. These accommodations are designed to offer comfort and
convenience for guests with mobility challenges, ensuring a welcoming and
inclusive environment for everyone. I always like to make an accessibility
note, as unfortunately not all resorts feature these accommodations.


üíµ Cost Considerations & Dining Options

The nightly rate of around $1,100 USD at the Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort
may seem steep, but the resort justifies this with its comprehensive luxury
offerings. Set in a prime location, the resort provides direct access to some
of Maui's finest beaches, along with exquisite amenities including multiple
infinity pools, a world-class spa, and diverse dining options.

While the buffet breakfast costs approximately $49 for adults and $24.50
for children, more economical choices like the Mokapu Market are available
for lighter eats or snacks. Lauren and I went to this market daily for ice
cream!

For gourmets, the Morimoto Maui restaurant offers an exceptional fusion
cuisine experience under the banner of Iron Chef Masaharu Morimoto.

The resort also features a local art shop that showcases Maui's rich culture
and craftsmanship. For those seeking a lavish escape or celebrating a special
occasion such as a honeymoon, the investment is well worth the
unforgettable experiences, as echoed by numerous couples we spoke to who
return here annually to celebrate their anniversaries.


üëó Evening Entertainment: Traditional Luau
Each evening brought new experiences. One of the highlights was the
traditional Luau, where we immersed ourselves in Hawaiian culture with
music, dance, and a feast featuring local specialties. The sunset views from
the resort added a magical touch to our evening meals and activities.
üå¥ Resort Amenities and Activities

One of the top reasons to book a stay at Andaz Maui is to enjoy the pristine
Mokapu and Wailea Beaches. Swimming in the crystal-clear, warm waters
with breathtaking views was an unforgettable experience. We revealed in the
sunshine on the soft, white sand and engaged in exciting water activities like
paddle boarding, kaiaking and snorkelling. Discovering brightly coloured
fish and turtles near the shore was truly remarkable.

Within the resort, we spent our days lounging on sun loungers, hopping
between pools, and sipping drinks at the tiki bars‚Äîa perfect way to relax
and soak in the ambiance.
The resort features 36 holes of golf, two vibrant poolside bars, and four onsite
restaurants. Indulge in self-care at the Awili Spa and Salon with
treatments from facials to body scrubs. Lauren & I preferred to stay
outdoors, but we did love shopping for beauty products at the spa.

Stay active with yoga and fitness classes available at the 24-hour gym or
unwind on the terrace and explore the on-site art gallery as I previously
mentioned as a resort highlight. Free in-room WiFi and a convenient
grocery store add to the comfort.
üçπ Final Thoughts and Recommendations
As we soaked in the sun and enjoyed the outdoor activities at the Andaz
Maui, we also recognized the broader conversations surrounding tourism in
Hawaii. Traveling here has become a topic of ethical discussion due to its
effects on the indigenous population and the environment. While the
beauty and allure of Maui are undeniable, it is essential to consider these
impacts as part of a responsible travel approach.

The Andaz Maui at Wailea Resort stands out for its commitment to
environmental sustainability and cultural integration. Notably, the resort was
constructed using 93% recycled materials and incorporates solar energy and
electric equipment to minimize its carbon footprint. By supporting local
wildlife preservation and showcasing local art, the resort contributes
positively to the cultural and environmental stewardship of Maui.

Being mindful of these issues, it's crucial for visitors to choose
accommodations and activities that support local communities and
sustainable practices. Whether it‚Äôs participating in cultural programs,
respecting sacred sites, or supporting local businesses, every small action
contributes to a more ethical travel experience.
