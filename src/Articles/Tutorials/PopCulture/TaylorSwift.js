Every year, I love picking out a couple of ornaments and a merch piece or two. This year, I found so many pieces I loved, making it hard to narrow down my choices. To help you decide if you are in the same boat, I thought I’d share my top picks and highlight the pieces that stood out the most. Let me know in the comments if you bought anything from this merch drop!
</p>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>The Tortured Poet’s Department Sweater</h2>
<ResponsiveIframeNew src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/997423?noHeader=true" />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
One of my favorite albums, The Tortured Poet’s Department (TTPD), inspired some beautifully neutral and wearable pieces this year. Since I’ve collected plenty of Taylor tees and long sleeves over the years, I opted for the TTPD V-neck cropped sweater in brown. The preppy white stripe is such a cute detail, and I can picture it tucked into jeans with a belt and boots or paired with a plaid skirt. This is a great option for incorporating Taylor merch into your fall/winter style without it being as bold as a graphic tee.
</p>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>Speaking of Crop Tees…</h2>
<ResponsiveIframeNew src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/997424?noHeader=true" />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
I absolutely love both crop T-shirts in this new drop! The Blink of a Crinkling Eye crop T-shirt is adorable, and the lace detail adds a vintage touch.
</p>
<p style={paragraphStyle}>
However, I chose the Self-Titled Stars That Shine baby T-shirt because I love the cream and pastel green combo, the butterfly design, and the retro sleeves. Its earthy, whimsical vibe suited me a bit better, but I think both tops are super cute and it depends on which color palette you prefer.
</p>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>The Bejeweled Ring</h2>
<ResponsiveIframeNew src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/997443?noHeader=true" />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
I quickly added the Taylor Swift Bejeweled ring to my cart. At $35, it’s a reasonable price point, and I adore the multicolored stones as a subtle nod to all of her eras. I always wear a stack of rings with emerald, blue stones, and tiger’s eye, so this piece felt like a nice addition representing the soundtrack to my life! Since it’s not real gold, I won’t wear it in the shower, but I love how it complements my everyday jewelry.
</p>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>Ornaments Galore!</h2>
<ResponsiveIframeNew src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/997441?noHeader=true" />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
I’m obsessed with Taylor Swift ornaments and collect them every year. Sadly, the TTPD typewriter ornament is sold out, but the Midnight Exile ornament is a great nod to her iconic Eras Tour.
</p>

<ResponsiveIframeNew src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/997439?noHeader=true" />
<p style={paragraphStyle}>
Other favorites include the Down the Rabbit Hole envelope ornament and That Ain’t My Merlot ornament with their vintage feel and pretty ribbons.
</p>

<ResponsiveIframeNew src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/997427?noHeader=true" />
<p style={paragraphStyle}>
However, I decided on the Self-Titled Butterfly Guitar ornament to add to my collection.
</p>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>Folklore and Lover Picks</h2>
<ResponsiveIframeNew src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/997438?noHeader=true" />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
For a non-cropped T-shirt option, the Folklore Album Moment in Time oversized T-shirt stood out with its rhinestone detailing.
</p>

<ResponsiveIframeNew src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/997437?noHeader=true" />
<p style={paragraphStyle}>
The folklore socks are another adorable nod to the era (though they’re sold out now), and I can imagine them looking cute over leggings and UGGs.
</p>
<p style={paragraphStyle}>

<ResponsiveIframeNew src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/997435?noHeader=true" />
<p style={paragraphStyle}>
From the Lover section, the Cruel Summer Crewneck is hands-down my favorite. While I didn’t choose it this time, the You Need to Calm Down Sleep Mask Ornament caught my eye as one of the cutest ornaments in the collection.
</p>
<p style={paragraphStyle}>

I wore a LOVER look to the Eras tour, and can’t believe the tour is coming to an end soon! If you want to watch a vlog of the experience in Tampa, FL - I’ve linked it below.
</p>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>Reputation and 1989 Favorites</h2>
<ResponsiveIframeNew src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/997434?noHeader=true" />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
While I love the Reputation album, it’s not quite my aesthetic. However, the Reputation Magnet Crop Sweater with its red snake detail is super wearable and perfect for fans of the era—it doesn’t scream merch, but Swifties will know the reference which is nice.
</p>

<ResponsiveIframeNew src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/997433?noHeader=true" />
<p style={paragraphStyle}>
Initially, I added the 1989 Taylor’s Version “Is It Over Now” Zip-Up Hoodie to my cart but ultimately chose the TTPD sweater instead. The vintage blue color looked cozy, but I decided I already had enough hoodies!
</p>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>Red and Self-Titled Decisions</h2>
<ResponsiveIframeNew src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/997431?noHeader=true" />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
I was also tempted by the Red Taylor’s Version “I Remember It All Too Well” Zip Polo. Red is one of my all-time favorite albums, but I tend to prefer pullovers without collars (my hair gets tangled). I even ran a poll on Instagram to help me decide between the red and brown sweaters! From reviews, I’ve seen the Red polo is super soft which is a plus.
</p>

<ResponsiveIframeNew src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/997430?noHeader=true" />
<p style={paragraphStyle}>
The Self-Titled collection also featured some adorable pieces. Last year, I purchased the Speak Now Taylor’s Version Cardigan Ornament, and this year I loved the ballet slippers ornament too. I ended up going with the Self Titled Guitar, again, I love me some butterflies.
</p>
<ResponsiveIframeNew src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/997428?noHeader=true" />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>

We’re almost done with the list, but we can’t forget a couple more Self-Titled debut album pieces. One of the cutest crewnecks, in my opinion, is the Dance All Night Long Kanga Pocket Crewneck. I adore the green shade, the subtle Taylor Swift signature, and the gorgeous illustration on the back of cowboy boots and a bow. I really fell in love with all the Self-Titled merch, but I decided my final item would be the Butterfly Tote Bag.
</p>

<ResponsiveIframeNew src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/997426?noHeader=true" />
<p style={paragraphStyle}>

The last item I added to cart is the Butterfly Tote Bag.I love embroidery, and tote bags don’t wear out as easily. Plus, I thought this would be a really cute addition to summer outfits, especially with the pops of gold.
</p>


<p style={paragraphStyle}>
So, that’s my roundup of standout pieces! Let me know if this guide helped you decide what to buy or if I missed any of your favorites. What did you end up ordering? Love to all my fellow Swifties, and I’ll see you in my next post!
