  We can‚Äôt have a list of girly halloween costumes without bringing back the 90s with the ultimate schoolgirl look inspired by <a style={linkStyle} href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Britney Spears‚Äô</a> iconic music video. Think pink fluffy hair ties, two high braided pigtails, and a classic smokey eye. Finish off with a grey cardigan, black pleated mini skirt, and knee-high socks for the ultimate nostalgia moment. I recreated Britney‚Äôs makeup with silver shimmers and bold lip liner to capture her bold yet innocent vibe.

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  For my photo, I used generative AI to create my background of 90s school lockers for that extra touch of nostalgia magic‚Äîcheck out my full tutorial to get the look below! Did you know Britney herself played a significant role in choosing the iconic schoolgirl outfit, which came together with affordable pieces that became a part of the video‚Äôs charm? ICONIC!

warm, muted tones on the eyes and a rustic-stained
lip to create a look that‚Äôs effortlessly chic. Pair with a
knit cardigan, plaid skirt, and vintage accessories to
capture that dreamy, cottagecore vibe. See it as
either a Taylor Swift Folklore costume, or just a great
fall outfit!
