ProRAW. This setting is great for those who want to fine-tune their photos during post-processing, but for quick and easy social media sharing, I prefer sticking to JPEGs. This article is more about iPhone carousel photos for Instagram.
Work Your Angles
Angles are crucial for flattering shots. If you’re on the shorter side like me, capturing images from a lower angle does wonders for elongating your legs as seen in most of the example shots.
However, if the lighting is lower, shooting from above will capture the most flattering light. Sometimes, the best photos come by chance when you experiment with different angles — my husband often surprises me with great shots when he switches up the angles on the fly!
I still am not the best with poses and creating interesting shapes with my body, so I don’t have a ton of suggestions for “modelling,” but I’m working on it! That being said, by tweaking these settings and following these tips, you’ll be well on your way to capturing stunning photos with your iPhone 13 Pro Max. Remember, practice makes perfect, so don’t be afraid to experiment and find your unique style. I hope this guide was helpful and have fun shooting. Want more inspiration? Follow me on instagram here.
