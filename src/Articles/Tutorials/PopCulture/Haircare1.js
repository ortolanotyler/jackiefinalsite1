      <h2 style={headingStyle}>SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER: High-End vs. Drugstore for Fine Hair</h2>
     
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Let's start with the foundation: a great shampoo and conditioner duo. One of my go-to favorites is the Kérastase Densifique Bain Densité Shampoo paired with the Fondant Densité Conditioner.
      </p>

      <ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977091?noHeader=truenoHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />
      <ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977092?noHeader=truenoHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />

      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        <em>Why It Works:</em> <br/> This duo is loaded with hyaluronic acid, gluco-peptides, and ceramides. Hyaluronic acid hydrates and plumps each strand, helping to prevent breakage and boost volume. Gluco-peptides work from within to strengthen the hair cuticle, while ceramides enhance shine, elasticity, and moisture retention.
      </p>
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        <em>Best For:</em> <br/> Perfect if you have fine, thinning, or flat hair and need a boost in density and texture. It’s especially great if your hair is thinning due to stress, hormonal changes, or over-styling.
      </p>

      <ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977094?noHeader=truenoHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />

      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        <em>Drugstore Alternative:</em> <br/> OGX Thick & Full + Biotin & Collagen Shampoo and Conditioner. This OGX duo is packed with biotin and collagen to help thicken and volumize, giving your hair a fuller look and feel.
      </p>

      <h2 style={headingStyle}>
  BEST SCENTED SHAMPOO & CONDITIONER

</h2>
<h3 style={headingStyle}>
Fable & Mane Holiroots Hydrating Shampoo
</h3>

<ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977098?noHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />
<ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977103?noHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  If you love a good tropical scent, Fable & Mane’s HoliRoots Hydrating Shampoo is a dream. I tried the version for all hair types and found it a bit heavy, but they also offer one specifically for fine hair, which I can’t wait to try.
</p>

<ul style={paragraphStyle}>
  
  <li><em>Why It Works :</em> <br/> This shampoo combines coconut milk, jasmine, and Ayurvedic extracts for a hydrating, luxurious experience with a scent that transports you to a tropical oasis.</li>
  <br/>
  <li><em>Best For :</em> <br/> Those with medium to thick hair needing extra hydration and smoothness.</li>
  <br/>
  <li><em>Drugstore Alternative :</em> <br/> Herbal Essences Coconut Milk Hydrate Shampoo</li>
</ul>

<ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977104?noHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  For a similar tropical, spa-like experience at a budget-friendly price, <a style={linkStyle} href="https://www.herbalessences.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Herbal Essences Coconut Milk Hydrate Shampoo</a> is perfect. It hydrates and has a delicious scent that lasts all day.
</p>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>BEST DETOX SHAMPOO</h2>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <em>High-End Detox Shampoo:</em> <br/> Ouai Detox Shampoo
</p>

<ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977109?noHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  For those deep-cleansing days, the Ouai Detox Shampoo is my go-to. It’s amazing for clearing out buildup from styling products, hard water, and oils, leaving your hair fresh and light.
</p>
<ul style={paragraphStyle}>

<li><em>Why It Works :</em> <br/> Ouai’s Detox Shampoo is infused with apple cider vinegar to clarify the scalp and balance pH. It also contains keratin to strengthen and protect, and it smells super fresh.</li>
  <br/>
  <li><em>Best For :</em> <br/> Ideal if you use a lot of styling products or live in an area with hard water. It’s especially helpful for those with oily scalps who want to keep their hair feeling cleaner for longer. (I tried a mini first and now can’t live without it!)</li>
  <br/>
  <li><em>Drugstore Alternative :</em> <br/> Neutrogena Anti-Residue Shampoo</li>
  <br/>
  </ul>
<ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977112?noHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  This affordable pick removes buildup just as well. It’s gentle on all hair types and leaves hair feeling light and refreshed.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <em>Tips for Using Detox Shampoo:</em> <br/> Apply to your scalp and gently massage for a few minutes before rinsing. Follow with a moisturizing conditioner to keep your hair from drying out.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Can’t afford ANOTHER shampoo? Try using your regular shampoo twice if you have build up. Sometimes hair just needs a really good wash!)
</p>

<p style={headingStyle}>SCALP CARE & HAIR REGROWTH</p>

<div style={{ position: 'relative', display: 'inline-block' }}>

    data-pin-description="Hair Growth Secrets by Jackie Wyers"
  />
 
</div>


<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Scalp care is key for hair growth! A tool I’ve been loving is the iRestore Hair Growth System, specifically for thinning hair.
</p>

<ul style={paragraphStyle}>
  <li><em>Why It Works :</em> <br/> iRestore uses Low-Level Light Therapy (LLLT), a technology also used in skincare. This device boosts cell energy, improves blood flow, and reduces inflammation on the scalp, promoting thicker, fuller hair.</li>
  <br/>
  <li><em>How to Use :</em> <br/></li>
  <ul style={paragraphStyle}>
    <li><em>Place the Helmet :</em> <br/> Wear it comfortably on your head.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><em>Turn It On :</em> <br/> Press the power button for a 25-minute session, done 3-4 times a week.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><em>Relax :</em> <br/> It’s hands-free, so you can watch TV or read while it works.</li>
  </ul>
  <br/>
  <li><em>Who It’s For :</em> <br/>   If you’re experiencing hair thinning, receding hairlines, or bald spots, this device can be a game-changer. For $625 off, use code ELITEJACKIE here: <a style={linkStyle} href="https://www.irestorelaser.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">iRestore Laser</a>.  </li>
</ul>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>DETANGLERS & LEAVE-IN CONDITIONERS</h2>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>
  Fable & Mane MahaMane Detangling Leave-In Conditioner
</h2>

<ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977121?noHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  For detanglers, Fable & Mane’s MahaMane Leave-In Conditioner is a must. It’s lightweight and smells amazing!
</p>

<ul style={paragraphStyle}>
  <li><em>Why It Works :</em> <br/> With aloe vera, amla, and red hibiscus, it hydrates, detangles, and offers heat protection up to 450°F without weighing your hair down.</li>
  <br/>
  <li><em>Drugstore Alternative :</em> <br/> Garnier Fructis Sleek & Shine Intensely Smooth Leave-In Conditioning Cream</li>
</ul>


<ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977127?noHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  This Garnier leave-in provides a smooth, detangled finish with argan oil and a lightweight feel that’s perfect for everyday.
</p>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>HAIR MASKS & SCALP CARE</h2>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>
  Coco & Eve Pro Youth Hair & Scalp Mask
</h2>

<ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977128?noHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Scalp care is essential for hair growth, and the Coco & Eve Pro Youth Hair & Scalp Mask does wonders. I don’t oil my scalp due to cyst concerns, but I rely on this mask to hydrate my roots. Use code JACKIE15 for 15% off!
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <em>Why It Works:</em> <br/> This mask combines manuka honey, propolis, and royal jelly extract to nourish the scalp, balance oils, and add shine. I use it every two weeks for ultra-soft hair.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <em>Drugstore Alternative:</em> <br/> L'Oréal Paris Elvive Total Repair 5 Power Restore Multi-Use Treatment
</p>

<ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977132?noHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  This budget-friendly mask repairs and nourishes with proteins and ceramides, restoring strength and hydration.
</p>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>BEST HAIR OILS</h2>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>
  Kérastase Elixir Ultime Original Hair Oil
</h2>

<ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977138?noHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  This hair oil is my secret weapon for hydrated, frizz-free hair. Enriched with camellia, argan, and maize oils, it’s perfect for shine and heat protection.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <em>Drugstore Alternative : </em> <br/> OGX Extra Strength Renewing + Argan Oil of Morocco Penetrating Oil
</p>

<ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977141?noHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  This OGX oil is a fantastic, budget-friendly option, delivering hydration and smoothness. I personally love the spray version to avoid getting oil on my hands! Check it out on <a style={linkStyle} href="https://www.ogxbeauty.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">OGX Beauty</a>.
</p>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>DRY SHAMPOOS</h2>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>
  Living Proof Perfect Hair Day Advanced Clean Dry Shampoo
</h2>

<ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977144?noHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  This dry shampoo is a must for busy days, absorbing oil, sweat, and odor so your hair feels freshly washed. Just spray, wait 30 seconds, massage, and brush out.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <em>Drugstore Alternative : </em> <br/>  BATISTE Tropical Exotic Coconut Dry Shampoo
</p>

<ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977147?noHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Batiste offers a refresh with added volume, making it a great budget alternative. It doesn’t last quite as long, but the scent is beautiful and it works in a pinch!
</p>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>HAIRSPRAYS</h2>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>
  Kenra Volume Spray 25
</h2>

<ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977151?noHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  If you need em hold, the Kenra Volume Spray 25 has you covered. It offers volume and a brushable hold that’s wind-resistant!
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <em>Drugstore Alternative:</em> <br/> OGX Bamboo Fiber Full Hairspray
</p>

<ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977154?noHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  I use this all the time in tutorials for its high hold. It leaves a film, so it might not be for everyday, but it’s my go-to for styling.
</p>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>ADDITIONAL TIPS FOR HEALTHY HAIR</h2>

<ul style={paragraphStyle}>
  <li> <em> Wash Frequency : </em> <br/>  Over-washing strips natural oils. Aim for 2-3 washes a week and use dry shampoo between.</li>
  <br/>
  <li><em> Microfiber Towels : </em> <br/> Swap regular towels for microfiber or cotton t-shirts to reduce frizz and breakage.</li>
  <br/>

  <li><em> Sleep Care : </em> <br/>  Use silk pillowcases and try loose braids or buns at night to prevent tangles.</li>
  <br/>

  <li> <em> Low-Stress Styles : </em> <br/> Opt for gentle styles like braids or low buns to minimize hair stress.</li>
 
  <br/>
  <li> <em> Limit Products :</em> <br/> Stick to essentials like a leave-in conditioner, light styling cream, and hair oil to avoid buildup.</li>
  <br/>

  <li> <em> Low vs. High Maintenance Styles : </em> <br/>  Low-maintenance looks like air-dried waves are gentler on hair compared to frequent heat styling.</li>
</ul>

<h2 style={headingStyle}>HAIR FRAGRANCE</h2>

<ResponsiveIframe src="https://shopmy.us/collections/public/977165?noHeader=true" style={iframeStyle} />

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  I couldn’t end without mentioning the <a style={linkStyle} href="https://www.gisou.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Gisou Honey Infused Wild Rose Hair Perfume</a>! This scent is an updated take on the nostalgic Pink Sugar hair perfume from the 2000s, and it’s my absolute favorite. Gisou’s packaging is so dreamy, and the scent truly lives up to the hype.
