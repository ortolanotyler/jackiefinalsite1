  We'll start with the oldest time period we will cover: <strong> The Tudor era. </strong>
</p>


<h2 style={headingStyle}>Time Period: Tudor Era (1485-1603)</h2>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <strong> The Tudor Period </strong> The Tudor period marked the end of the 
  <strong> medieval era </strong> and the beginning of the 
  <strong> English Renaissance. </strong> It was characterized by significant political, social, and religious changes, with the monarchy's power being a central theme. The real story of Lady Jane Grey is beyond tragic—she was a teenager thrust onto the throne as a political pawn in the schemes of powerful nobles. She reigned as queen for just nine days in July 1553 before being deposed by Mary I. Jane was eventually executed in 1554 for treason after refusing to renounce her Protestant faith.

            <p style={paragraphStyle}>
  The TV series “My Lady Jane” (2024) rewrites Jane’s fate, transforming her from a damsel-in-distress into a heroine who saves herself and her kingdom. This uplifting series has created a modern #TudorCore aesthetic with styling traits of soft, whimsical, and slightly undone hairstyles, reflecting the natural beauty ideal of the time. It was common for women to wear their hair long and loose or in intricate braids, adorned with flowers and ribbons. In the show, Jane’s no-makeup makeup look includes dewy skin, rustic tones like burnt orange on the lids, and deep pink lip stains, emphasizing a natural yet polished appearance as seen in my tutorial with Prime Video

<h2 style={headingStyle}> Time Period: 18th Century, Golden Age of Piracy (1650-1730)
    </h2>

    <p style={paragraphStyle}>
  The Golden Age of Piracy was a time of adventure and danger on the high seas, spanning from the late 17th to early 18th centuries. This era was marked by infamous pirates like Blackbeard and Anne Bonny, and the bustling port towns where they plied their trade. Fashion from this period was influenced by both practicality and the opulent styles of the European courts, merging functionality with flamboyance. Learn more about pirate fashion on

  "Pirates of the Caribbean”(2003) with its daring adventures and iconic characters, brings to life the romance and peril of this period.

  Elizabeth Swann’s hairstyles in the films often feature rolled updos reminiscent of the 18th century. These styles were elegant and functional as seen in

Her hair often included intricate curls and was sometimes accessorized with hats, reflecting the opulent yet practical nature of the era.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  While historical accuracy might lean towards minimal makeup, the films enhance Elizabeth’s adventurous and bold character with a slightly more dramatic look. For a modern interpretation, a deeper eye makeup can add a sultry touch. Try Smoky eyes paired with a natural lip colour to balance the look as seen in my recreation tutorial

The styling in "Pride and Prejudice," particularly for Elizabeth Bennet, epitomizes the understated elegance of the Regency era. Hair was often styled in soft, natural curls and undone styles.

      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
  In the TV series “Bridgerton” (2020), Daphne Bridgerton is crowned “The Diamond of the Season” and wore delicate updos with accessories such as feathers, ribbons, and jewelled pins. There are no shortage of hair accessories on the set! While not necessarily historically accurate, the feel of Daphne’s season 1 and 2 looks are very high society yet youthful, and can easily be worn today. For makeup, her fresh and subtle look consisted of soft peach tones, light blush, and minimal eye makeup. Highlighting and lip liner became more pronounced in later seasons of "Bridgerton," adding a touch of modern glamour for those who prefer a bolder look.

The looks in the film "Little Women,”(2019) especially Amy’s, feature beautiful twisted and braided updos that are soft and perfect for a hot
summer day. These styles offer an elegant and practical solution for managing long hair in the heat and are often adorned with ribbons and flowers for a soft, romantic look. The makeup palette was muted, with just touches of pink on the cheeks and lips, emphasizing natural beauty. A tip for achieving the no-makeup makeup look is to focus on well-groomed, fuller brows, especially if the hair is pulled off the face. Fuller, youthful brows can frame the face and allow your natural features to shine without heavy makeup.
