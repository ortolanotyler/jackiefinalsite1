  The fresh-faced look of Rory Gilmore was carefully crafted by talented makeup artists throughout the series. In later seasons, <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0853242/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tegan Taylor</a> was one of the key makeup artists who worked on the show, bringing Rory’s no-makeup makeup aesthetic to life. Taylor has shared some of the exact products used on the actors in the later seasons as seen in this <a href="https://eliza.co.uk/beauty/gilmore-girls-makeup" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">interview</a>, though finding the precise Y2K-era products can be a challenge today. Staples like sheer foundations, natural blushes, and the iconic Cherry ChapStick were essential in creating <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0088127/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alexis Bledel’s</a> look as Rory.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  While tracking down the exact makeup products used on Gilmore Girls in the early 2000s can be challenging, I’ve recreated Rory’s look using affordable K-beauty products that beautifully capture her natural, fresh-faced aesthetic. These modern alternatives offer the same soft, bookish finish that Rory Gilmore’s makeup is known for, making it easy for anyone to achieve her timeless, no-makeup makeup style. And let’s not forget, Rory’s best friend, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lane_Kim" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lane Kim</a>, did visit South Korea—so I love to imagine she brought back some of these K-beauty gems for Rory to try!
</p>

      <h2 style={headingStyle}>Achieving Rory's No-Makeup Makeup Look 👀</h2>

      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Rory Gilmore’s makeup always looks like she just woke up looking naturally beautiful. The key is to use sheer, buildable products that enhance rather than cover. I’ve used a selection of K-beauty products that are affordable and perform beautifully—let’s pretend Lane brought these back from her trip to South Korea!
      </p>

      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Base Makeup: Opt for a lightweight, glowing cushion foundation like the Jelly Cushion in shade 03 Honey. This foundation adds just a touch of coverage, letting your skin’s natural beauty shine through.
      </p>

      <ResponsiveIframe

      </ResponsiveIframe>

      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Subtle Concealing: Skip the brightening concealer and choose a salmon-toned one instead, which subtly corrects dark circles without looking too obvious. Tap it in with your fingers for a more natural finish.
      </p>

      <ResponsiveIframe
        title="Concealer"

        style={{ width: '100%', minHeight: '1200px', border: 'none' }}>
      </ResponsiveIframe>

      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Soft, Blushy Cheeks: A signature of the Gilmore Girls look is natural blush, like they’ve just been out in the crisp Connecticut air. Use a cream blush like Amuse’s Soft Cream Cheek in Pink Toast and blend it onto the apples of your cheeks, creating a soft V-shape that mimics Rory’s youthful flush. Set with a lightweight powder by pressing onto the skin with a puff.
      </p>

      <ResponsiveIframe

        style={{ width: '100%', minHeight: '1200px', border: 'none' }}>
      </ResponsiveIframe>

      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Natural Brows and Eyes: Rory’s brows are never overdone; they’re light and naturally filled in. Use a soft brow pencil in a gentle brown shade and skip the heavy brow gels. For eyes, keep it simple with a wash of light pink and brown shadows, subtly blended into the crease for depth. Finish with a smudge-free mascara like Hamish for defined but not overly dramatic lashes.
      </p>

      </ResponsiveIframe>

      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Tinted Lips: For lips, go with a natural tint that mimics the iconic Cherry ChapStick vibes. Start with a nude or pink lip tint like Fig Brown and top it with a sheer gloss or balm to keep things looking fresh and kissable.
      </p>

      <h2 style={headingStyle}>Achieving Rory Gilmore’s Hairstyles 🤎</h2>

      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Throughout the seasons, Rory tried out various haircuts and hairstyles! Season One features hair a little longer than shoulder length, cut to one length with subtle face-framing layers. I recreated various Rory Gilmore Season One hairstyles years ago on my <a href="https://drinkingcoffeewatchingtv.com/en/gilmore-girls-filming-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> </a>YouTube channel. This tutorial was one of my early videos before I mastered resembling a character, but the hairstyles still totally capture the Rory vibe no matter the hair length.

  Let’s talk fall fashion inspiration! Rory’s wardrobe is a cozy, preppy dream—think knitted sweaters, plaid skirts, and lots of layering. For this look, I’m drawing inspiration from her dreaming of Yale days, strolling through <a href="https://drinkingcoffeewatchingtv.com/en/gilmore-girls-filming-locations/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stars Hollow</a>.
</p>


<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Sweaters Galore: A must-have in Rory’s wardrobe is a collection of classic sweaters. Opt for a cable knit or a light blue crewneck to match Rory’s iconic looks from the series. Layering is key, so don’t be afraid to add a collared shirt underneath for that extra touch of <a href="https://www.vogue.com.au/shopping/preppy-style/image-gallery/30b1005e82d38980d9a027cd095433fd" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">preppy style</a>.

      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Tip: Try thrifting Y2K Ralph Lauren sweaters from Postmark, Ebay, or local thrift stores!
      </p>

      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Plaid & Pleats: Plaid skirts and pleated skirts always pair nicely with cable knit sweaters and are the perfect fall transitional piece. Pair them with knee-high boots, loafers or sneakers for the perfect Rory fall ensemble.
      </p>

      </ResponsiveIframe>
      
      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
        Accessorize with Simplicity: Keep jewelry minimal and dainty, just like Rory would. A small choker or a set of stud earrings adds the perfect touch without overwhelming the look. Try a casual tote bag, converse sneakers and loafers for a daily look.
      </p>

        Bookish Vibes: No Rory-inspired look is complete without a good book! Whether it’s a classic novel or your favorite coffee shop read, having a book in hand is the ultimate Rory accessory. Pair it with a cute tote bag that can carry all your essentials (and maybe a coffee or two from Luke’s).

  Did you know that the pilot episode of Gilmore Girls was filmed in the quaint town of <a href="https://unionville.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unionville, Ontario</a>, Canada? I recently visited this charming spot, which doubled as the iconic Stars Hollow. Walking through Unionville feels like stepping right into Rory’s world—from the cozy storefronts to the picturesque streets. I even explored some of the exact locations used in the show, like the famous church steps and the town square. You can watch my full vlog of this magical visit below and see how Unionville truly captures the essence of Stars Hollow. It’s a must-see for any Gilmore Girls fan wanting to experience a piece of Rory’s world in real life!
