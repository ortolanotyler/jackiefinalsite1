      <DropCap text="Welcome back to All Things Bridal! If you are new to my channel, here‚Äôs a bit of backstory about my upcoming wedding ceremony in July. My husband Tyler and I have been legally married for two years which is why I call his my husband and not fianc√©, but we held off on having a wedding ceremony to save up for a celebration in Sorrento, Italy. We're also planning a trip afterward to Belgium, where we met in middle school many years ago. Excited is an understatement! " />

      <p style={paragraphStyle}>
      I‚Äôll share an article on how I went about planning the wedding, including details about my custom wedding dress and accessories. But for today‚Äôs article, let‚Äôs talk DIY bridesmaid proposal boxes!
     </p>

     <div>
        <img src={image1} alt="Signature" style={{ width: '100%' }} />

      <p style={paragraphStyle}>

      I didn‚Äôt know this was a thing until fairy recently, so if you haven‚Äôt been in a wedding party before, these are gift boxes that brides-to-be give their bridesmaids as a special way of asking them to be part of their wedding party.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
You can go in many directions when crafting your own bridesmaid proposal boxes, but they typically contain personalized items like jewelry, picture frames, beauty items and a heartfelt note or card.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
If you are a bride-to-be looking for inspiration for your own bridesmaid boxes, I hope this is helpful.
</p>


<div>
        <img src={image2} alt="Signature" style={{ width: '100%' }} />

      <p style={{ textAlign: 'center', fontSize: '1rem', fontFamily: 'Arapey, sans-serif', margin: '0em', maxWidth: '100%', fontStyle: 'italic' }}>

      Please keep in mind that you can create a bridesmaid proposal box on a budget. I only had three bridesmaids, so I was able to spend a little more, but it is not necessary by any means. I also see a lot of influencer proposal boxes with many gifted items through PR, so don‚Äôt feel like you need to spend a ton of money to make a special box for your potential bridesmaids. It should be a fun experience putting these together, not a stressful one!

    üïä How to Create Your Bridesmaid Proposal Boxes

</h2>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>

1. Choose Your Box: First, you will need a box! You can get them in bulk on Amazon, but I found three boxes from Winners, a discount store in Canada. I loved the sage green whimsical pattern, which matched my bridesmaids' dresses. These sturdy boxes can double as memory boxes.
</p>

      <p style={{ textAlign: 'right', fontSize: '0.75rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '-0.5em 0', maxWidth: '100%' }}>
        CONTAINS: AFFILIATE LINKS
      </p>


<p style={paragraphStyle}>

2. Fill the Box: Start with shredded paper and
layer over some pretty tissue paper. I chose tissue paper with gold bees to match an earthy, fairytale aesthetic. Satin napkins can also create a more luxurious feel if that suits your vibe.
</p>

      <p style={{ textAlign: 'right', fontSize: '0.75rem', fontFamily: 'GFS Didot, serif', margin: '-0.5em 0', maxWidth: '100%' }}>
        CONTAINS: AFFILIATE LINKS
      </p>


<p style={paragraphStyle}>

3. Personal Touches: I chose a fairytale gold
picture frame with a photo of each of my bridesmaids. These frames look like they are from Anthropologie but are actually from Winners. I‚Äôve linked similar frames below in a similar aesthetic, with different price ranges.

        CONTAINS: AFFILIATE LINKS
      </p>


<p style={paragraphStyle}>

4. Useful and Beautiful Items: You can‚Äôt go wrong
with a beautiful pen. I love the Noda brand from Indigo or Chapters. The pens I chose matched
the green and gold theme and had gold flakes and purple flowers floating around the top.
</p>

        CONTAINS: AFFILIATE LINKS
      </p>


<p style={paragraphStyle}>

5. Body Care: Since we will be traveling, I thought a hand cream would be a nice touch. I chose my favorite scent from L‚ÄôOccitane. You can‚Äôt go wrong with their Almond range!
</p>

        CONTAINS: AFFILIATE LINKS
      </p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
6. Jewelry: My entire wedding theme is enchanting and earthy, so I selected jewelry pieces from Fabel England‚Äôs Whispering Sands collection. We will be on the coast in Sorrento, and this collection carries beautiful jewelry, fans, accessories, and silk PJs in a nautical aesthetic. Perfect for a summer wedding gift.

      </p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>

7. Sweet Treats: Mason jars filled with candy add a fun touch. Initially, I went with my bridesmaids' favorite treats, but I changed to Amalfi drops since we will be visiting the Amalfi Coast. These are so tasty. üçã

        CONTAINS: AFFILIATE LINKS
      </p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>

8. Beauty Products: When I think of ethereal, whimsical beauty products, Gucci Beauty comes
to mind. I added mini sample sets to each box. These samples are adorable mini versions of the actual aesthetically pleasing bottles, allowing your bridesmaids to try them out without much risk if it‚Äôs not their fav scent. I‚Äôve seen adorable perfume mini‚Äôs by Marc Jacobs and Dior too that are tiny versions of the full size bottle.
</p>

      </p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
9. Aromatic Additions: Some dried florals, which smelled amazing also from L‚ÄôOccitane, were added to the boxes. Alternatively, you could spritz your favorite perfume so the box smells like you as they open their gift.

10. Personal Notes: For a card, Rifle Paper Co. or Papyrus has beautiful options. I wrote a
handwritten letter to each bridesmaid and my maid of honour (my sister), placed in an envelope with a gold sticker. I also used cursive gold stickers to write out their names and added 3-D butterfly stickers, also in gold, from Michael‚Äôs. (Shopmy)

      </p>



<p style={paragraphStyle}>

11. Finishing Touch: Finish with a bow on top of the box. A great idea from Delany Child that she did for her bridesmaid box, was to add a big, oversized hair bow on top of the box to double as a hair accessory. Fun!
