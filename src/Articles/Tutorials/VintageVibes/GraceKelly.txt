  The <a href="https://www.tiktok.com" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok beauty community</a> was buzzing with speculation about how the iconic <a href="https://www.patmcgrath.com" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pat McGrath</a> achieved such doll-like skin perfection prior to Pat’s Masterclass over the weekend - and astoundingly, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/erinparsonsmakeup/" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Erin Parsons</a>—a celebrated makeup artist and makeup historian in her own right—hit the nail on the head with her prediction of this inventive technique.

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  As I watched the <a href="https://www.maisonmargiela.com" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Margiela Masterclass</a> this Saturday, I was glued to my screen, attentively watching and simultaneously recreating one of my favorite looks from the show as seen above. Here’s the scoop on what I learned and a step-by-step account of how I transformed myself into a hauntingly beautiful, poetic Victorian doll. Tap image below to be taken to my <a href="https://jackiewyers.beauty/mini-tutorials" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mini tutorial</a>.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  In the masterclass, it was demonstrated that <a href="https://www.patmcgrath.com/products/divine-skin-rose-001-the-essence" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PAT MCGRATH LABS | Divine Skin Rose 001 The Essence</a> was applied to ensure hydration and longevity of makeup, along with the <a href="https://www.patmcgrath.com/products/skin-fetish-sublime-perfection-primer" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skin Fetish: Sublime Perfection Primer</a>. For models with paler complexions, a white shade from <a href="https://us.kryolan.com/product/486/ultra-foundation" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kryolan</a> was mixed into the <a href="https://www.patmcgrath.com/products/skin-fetish-sublime-perfection-foundation" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skin Fetish: Sublime Perfection Foundation</a> and <a href="https://www.patmcgrath.com/products/skin-fetish-sublime-perfection-concealer" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Concealer</a> to enhance the porcelain effect.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Models with deeper complexions kept their skin tone true to themselves, allowing each model to personify a unique porcelain doll in a makeup look that was flattering on each person. The face wasn't powdered after foundation, as the airbrushed peel-off mask adhered better to cream-based products. However, the <a href="https://www.patmcgrath.com/products/skin-fetish-sublime-perfection-blurring-under-eye-powder" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skin Fetish: Sublime Perfection Blurring Under-Eye Powder</a> was used for setting the area directly under the eyes. A new light pink powder was teased on the live, which is worth trying upon its release!
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Blush was emphasized as a key element in each look. The <a href="https://www.patmcgrath.com/products/divine-blush" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Divine Blush: Legendary Glow Colour Balm in Peach Lotus</a> was a popular choice throughout the show. To intensify the cheek color and ensure long wear, the <a href="https://www.patmcgrath.com/products/divine-blush" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Skin Fetish: Divine Blush</a> was applied. The blush should extend from the apple of the cheek upwards, nearing the eye, allowing the eyeshadow to seamlessly transition into the blush for an avant-garde style.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  For the eyeshadow, dimension was emphasized on the inner and outer portion of the lid. <a href="https://www.patmcgrath.com/products/permagel-ultra-glide-eye-pencil-blk-coffee" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blk Coffee Liner</a> was applied as a base, smudging it with a finger for a softer effect. The <a href="https://www.patmcgrath.com/products/mothership-i-eyeshadow-palette-subliminal" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mothership I Eyeshadow Palette in Subliminal</a> was frequently used behind the scenes. However, I thought the <a href="https://www.patmcgrath.com/products/mothership-vi-eyeshadow-palette-midnight-sun" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mothership VI Eyeshadow Palette in Midnight Sun</a>'s grungy green, champagne, gold, and taupe shades were quite fitting for my inspired look.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  For the lips, start with a deeper lip liner, blending through the center of the parted lips. Then, using Pat's finger-blurring technique, apply <a href="https://www.patmcgrath.com/products/mattetrance-lipstick-guinevere" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MatteTrance Lipstick in Guinevere</a>, a crimson shade, focusing on the center to mimic a porcelain doll's lips. For those inspired by a model with fuller lips, try lining the entire lip and patting on the lipstick from there. Slightly blurring the edges was recommended to soften the overall appearance if you go this route!
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  From trying this look out myself, I recommend avoiding rushing the layers. I wanted to make sure I could take a quality picture while I had some natural sunlight, so I only did three layers as the sun was going down. However, what really gives the porcelain doll effect is being patient and allowing each layer to dry. Use a medium heat flow dryer to let the mask dry before going in and adding as many layers as possible. If there is texture to the skin (like peach fuzz sticking up), a tip is to use a <a href="https://www.beautyblender.com" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Beauty Blender</a> to softly pat down onto the skin post-spray.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  This iconic look, three years in the making, was crafted to experiment and find an amazing glazing effect that would bring porcelain doll skin to life. Pat teased a new <a href="https://www.patmcgrath.com" style={linkStyle} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pat McGrath Labs</a> product coming soon that will provide this effect, eliminating the need to create a mix. Stay tuned!

  Applying self-tanner the night before can really help create a harmonious, warm canvas. Make sure you’ve moisturized the skin before makeup, and we are going with no foundation for this style, but I gave my skin a boost with <a href="https://www.charlottetilbury.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ color: 'black' }}>Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter</a> for a sheer glow with a hint of coverage.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  My favorite palette for warming up the skin and highlighting is the <a href="https://www.makeupforever.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ color: 'black' }}>Make Up For Ever HD Skin sculpting palette</a>. These shades are sheer, so again the base won’t appear too heavy. While the foundation is natural, this style of makeup does call for contour and highlight!
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Benefit Cosmetics <a href="https://www.benefitcosmetics.com/en-us/product/hoola-caramel" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ color: 'black' }}>Hoola Caramel</a> is a great pick if you are fair-medium in skin tone. You can rock this look no matter your complexion, but it will suit warmer coloring best. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okXpvzknH9w&t=555s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ color: 'black' }}>See the espresso look for cool-toned skin</a>!
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Next, add a brown liner pencil to rim the lash line and softly fade into the crease. The <a href="https://colourpop.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ color: 'black' }}>ColourPop</a> lipliner I used called BFF 3 is really creamy and easy to blend for this step, plus it is lighter than most traditional eyeliners on the market, making it appear softer. Make sure you're not using the eyeliner on the lips and eyes and sanitize between uses if you do opt for a lipliner on the eyes!
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Continue by picking a palette that has warm matte and shimmer tones like <a href="https://www.onesizebeauty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ color: 'black' }}>ONE/SIZE BY PATRICK STARRR | Visionary Eyeshadow Palette</a> to deepen up the outer corner of the eye and add a bronzer shimmer to the lid to pick up the light.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Inspired by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/taniellejaimua" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ color: 'black' }}>Tanielle Jai</a>’s work, her models typically rock very bold, Brooke Shields-esque brows. Fill your brows in with natural strokes and set in place with a brow gel. I went REALLY bold, so feel free to tone the brow down to suit your preferences!
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  Using a liquid liner, create more drama on the lash line and use this same liner to add beauty marks or faux freckles. This is a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/taniellejaimua" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={{ color: 'black' }}>Tanielle Jai</a> signature step that is super fun to try out. Pop on an outer corner lash, and the eyes are complete!
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  For the lips, over-line them with a medium-toned caramel brown shade, and blur out again for no harsh lines. Add a lip plumper for a fuller look in a milky pink or nude shade.
</p>

For a full guide on how to prep your skin, check out my detailed <a href="https://jackiewyers.beauty/skinprep" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>bridal skin prep guide</a> that ensures a flawless base for your big day.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <strong>Skin Prep:</strong> It's crucial! Start prepping your skin well ahead of the big day. Stay hydrated and ensure you're well-rested. For a pre-makeup boost, I recommend using <a href="https://jackiewyers.beauty/valmont-prime-renewing-pack" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>Valmont's Prime Renewing Pack</a>, which works wonders as an overnight mask and a pre-foundation moisturizer.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <strong>Foundation:</strong> My favourite summer foundation is the <a href="https://www.charlottetilbury.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>Charlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin Foundation</a> for photo-ready coverage. For those seeking more coverage, try <a href="https://www.giorgioarmanibeauty-usa.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>Giorgio Armani’s Luminous Silk Foundation</a>—just make sure to test any foundation well before your wedding day.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <strong>Highlight and Contour:</strong> I used <a href="https://www.mariomakeup.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>Mario’s Sculpting Stick</a> for contouring and <a href="https://www.yensa.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>Yensa's Super Serum Silk Concealer</a> to cancel out any darkness under the eyes. For more tips, visit my <a href="https://jackiewyers.beauty/contour-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>contour guide</a>.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <strong>Blushing Bride Cheeks:</strong> The focal point of the look was the <a href="https://www.rarebeauty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>Rare Beauty Luminous Blush</a> paired with <a href="https://www.charlottetilbury.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>Charlotte Tilbury's Spotlight Highlight</a>. Check out more blush tips in my <a href="https://jackiewyers.beauty/blushingbride" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>blush guide</a>.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <strong>Brows:</strong> I kept my brows full and natural using <a href="https://www.florasis.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>Florasis Luodai Eyebrow Pencil</a> and the <a href="https://www.benefitcosmetics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>Benefit 24-hour brow setter</a>. For more, see my <a href="https://jackiewyers.beauty/brow-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>brow tutorial</a>.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <strong>A Nostalgic Eye Palette:</strong> For eyes, I chose neutral tones from the <a href="https://www.maccosmetics.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>Cinderella and MAC Collection</a>—a nod to my early YouTube days. For more vintage-inspired looks, visit my <a href="https://jackiewyers.beauty/vintageeyes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>vintage eye makeup collection</a>.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <strong>Lashes & Lips:</strong> Complete your bridal look with soft lashes from <a href="https://www.velourbeauty.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>Velour</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>Isopia lashes</a>. For lips, I preferred the cooler, deeper tones of <a href="https://www.charlottetilbury.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>Charlotte Tilbury’s Iconic Nude</a>.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <strong>Setting the Makeup:</strong> A good setting spray is a must! I recommend the <a href="https://jackiewyers.beauty/mistofdawn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>Mist of Dawn</a> for its fine mist and long-lasting power. For more tips, read my <a href="https://jackiewyers.beauty/setting-spray-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>setting spray guide</a>.
</p>

<p style={paragraphStyle}>
  <strong>Final Verdict:</strong> This makeup trial was a success! Drawing subtle inspiration from beauty icons like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hotUsepeDgc&t=15s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>Margot Robbie</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yC8Sf9U3Aww&t=24s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" style={linkStyle}>Brooke Shields</a>, the products held up great.

  Since I will be outside for much of the wedding day, I will skip gloss and go for a balm for moisture, but less stickiness.
