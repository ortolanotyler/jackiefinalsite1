Hey beauties, it‚Äôs Jackie! Today,
we're diving into a fun and fresh
way to explore beauty styles with
our "Types of Pretty" makeup series
inspired by adorable animals like deer, cats,
foxes, and bunnies. Whether you saw this
trend on TikTok or my latest YouTube
tutorial, I‚Äôm thrilled to bring this unique
concept to the blog where we break down
each style with detailed makeup guides.



Deer Pretty: Soft and Ethereal ü¶å

Inspired by the gentle features of a deer,
this makeup style is all about soft, doe-like
eyes and a warm, glowing complexion. If
you are in the Soft or Deep Autumn colour
season, this look is a great fit.
Celebrity Inspirations:
Jessica Alba, Leighton Meester, Emmy
Russum, Tessa Thompson and Charithra
Chandran rock this look with their big,
round eyes and stunning skin tones.
Achieve the Deer Pretty look:
Eyes: Start with a neutral brown shadow
from the Makeup by Mario Master Mattes
palette, then tight line your eyes with dark
brown eyeliner. Add a peach liner to your
waterline for that soft doe-eyed effect.
Lashes: A full, wispy set of falsies suit the
doe-eyed style. Try ISOPIA Iso-Gentle
Touch Lashes.
Cheeks: Use a peachy blush on the tops of
your cheeks to bring warmth and
brightness to your face along with a
champagne highlight.
Lips: Go for a nude lipliner, slightly over
lining for a fuller appearance. Finish with a
matte peach lip colour for a natural, yet
enhanced look.
Outfit Inspiration: To fully embody the
Deer Pretty theme, choose dainty and
whimsical styles. Try outfits in earthy and
pastel palettes that resonate with the
natural and soft aesthetics of a deer. Fabrics
like lace and florals are perfect for this look,
adding a touch of femininity and grace.
Free People is a great store to try.

inspiration? Fable England has beautiful

embroidered bags featuring fawn designs.
Cat Pretty: Bold and Intense üêà‚¨õ
Embody the allure of the nocturnal feline
with the 'Cat Pretty' makeup style,
characterized by its sharp, angular features
and a striking high-contrast palette suitable
for those embracing the True or Clear
Winter colour palette.
Celebrity Inspirations:
Examples include Bella Hadid and Megan
Fox. For deeper skin tones, think Rihanna,
with those light green, cat-like eyes, and
Zoe Kravitz, with her sharp, kitty-like
features. We'll explore warmer smokey eyes
in the ‚ÄúFox Pretty‚Äù look and keep it cool
toned for this fierce style.
Achieve the Cat Pretty look:
Eyes: Sweep cool-toned shimmers, like
silver and white, across your lids and
deepen up with taupe in the crease.
Victoria Beckham Beauty Smoky Eye
Brick in Tuxedo is the perfect palette.
Draw a bold, winged eyeliner that extends
beyond the outer corners to enhance the
cat-eye illusion and enhance the outer
corner with a black shadow.
Lashes: Go for dramatic, fanned-out lashes
that complement the bold liner, amplifying
the overall eye makeup. Try ISOPIA Iso-
Gentle Echo Lashes.
Cheeks: Sculpt your cheeks with a cooltoned
contour powder to add depth and
enhance your natural bone structure,
mimicking the chiseled look typical of a
sleek feline.
Lips: Select deep mauve tones for a
seductively pouty effect or go for a nude lip
combo. A high-shine gloss can add
dimension and a touch of glamour.
Outfit Inspiration: Channel '90s off-duty
supermodel vibes with structured yet casual
elements. Think fitted black tanks paired
with low-waisted baggy jeans. Explore
Revolve for trendy, contemporary pieces
and local thrift stores for genuine '90s gems
like sleek sunglasses.
Fox Pretty: Rustic and Earthy ü¶ä
Embrace the charm of the red fox with this
bohemian makeup style, perfect for those in
the True Autumn colour category. Think
earthy metallics and softly smudged lips,
capturing the essence of the wild and
whimsical.
Celebrity Inspirations:
Sadie Sink is the quintessential muse for
this look, with her rustic red hues in her
hair and brows. Her natural beauty
enhanced with earthy makeup perfectly
captures the Fox Pretty aesthetic.
Note: If you're a redhead with bright blue eyes
and vibrant hair that leans more towards the
Spring colour season, you might find the
‚ÄúBunny Pretty‚Äù guide with its softer pink shades
more flattering than the rustic tones of Fox
Pretty.
Achieve the Fox Pretty look:
Eyes: Choose warm, copper shades smoked
out in a soft v, and use minimal liner to
keep the eyes striking yet natural. The
Bareminerals Warmth Minerals Palette is
perfect to create this style. This approach
enhances the eyes without overshadowing
the inherent beauty of your features.
Lashes: Extend the lash line along the
winged out shadow. Try ISOPIA Iso-Gentle
Healing Lashes for a subtle effect.
Cheeks: Apply dual blush tones‚Äîa rose
shade for a vibrant pop of colour and a
deeper rose to define the cheekbones.
Lips: A matte berry or a rustic red lip,
smudged out for a softer, more
approachable look. Add a touch of golden
metallic highlight to the cheekbones and
pat over the centre of the lip for a unique,
textured finish.
Outfit Inspiration: Dive into a bohemian
vibe with lively prints. Anthropologie is an
excellent starting point for this style. Select
paisley or other small prints in rustic tones
to complement the boho aesthetic
beautifully. This style not only matches the
rich-toned makeup but also ties the whole
look together.
Don't forget to check out Fable England
for fox-themed accessories that add a
charming final touch.
Bunny Pretty: Cute and Angelic
Channel the delicate charm of the bunny
with shades of pink that mirror a bunny's
tongue, creating a look that is both cute and
angelic. This style is perfect for
experimenting with the viral Sephora
‚Äúbunny tongue‚Äù lip gloss that's taking social
media by storm.
This style complement those in Spring and
Summer colour palettes, altering the look
to either a warm or cool toned pink.
Celebrity Inspirations:
Elle Fanning is the epitome of Bunny
Pretty with her angelic presence. Other
stars like Amandla Stenberg and Zendaya
also beautifully pull off this style,
showcasing how versatile and flattering it
can be across different skin tones.
Achieve the Bunny Pretty look:
Eyes: Apply a soft wash of pink over your
lids, adding a touch of shimmer to the brow
bone and inner corners to brighten and
open up the eye area. Charlotte Tilbury
Pillow Talk Eyeshadow Palette is a
beautiful option.
Lashes: Curl your lashes for a natural lift,
focusing on the upper lashes only to keep
the look light and fresh. Try ISOPIA Iso-
Gentle Harmony Lashes for extra length.
Cheeks: Embrace a rosy flush with a
heavier application of blush. Milani Coral
Cove is an excellent choice for a warmer
pink, while Rare Beauty's blush in Happy
suits cooler undertones. Don't be shy with
the blush to achieve that vibrant, youthful
glow.
Lips: Start with a nude pink lip liner to
define your lips, then layer on the Sephora
Collection Pink Pout Lipgloss for a glossy,
vibrant finish that complements the blushy
cheeks.
Outfit Inspiration:
Lean into the Bunny Pretty theme with
soft, flowing fabrics in pinks tones. Try flirty
dresses in pastel colours that enhance the
sweetness of this look. Brands like For
Love & Lemons offer a variety of options
that can perfectly complement the Bunny
Pretty makeup.
Additionally, accessories from Fable
England, such as bunny-themed jewelry,
can add a whimsical touch to complete your
outfit as mentioned in the looks above.
